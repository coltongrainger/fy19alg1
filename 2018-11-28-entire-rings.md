From Lang [@Lan02, section II.1]:

> Most of the rings without zero divisors which we consider will be commutative. In view of this, we define a ring $A$ to be **entire** if $1 \neq 0$, if $A$ is commutative, and if there are no zero divisors in the ring. (Entire rings are also called **integral domains**. However, linguistically, I feel the need for an adjective. "Integral" would do, except that in English "integral" has been used for "integral over a ring". In French, as in English, two words exist with similar roots: "integral" and "entire". The French have used both words. Why not do the same in English? There is a slight psychological impediment, in that it would have been better if the use of "integral" and "entire" were reversed to fit the long-standing French use. I don't know what to do about this.)

\gvn A subfield $\FF$ of $\RR$. 

\wts $\FF$ contain $\QQ$.

\pf The entire ring of integers $\ZZ$ has field of fractions $\QQ$. If a field $\FF$ contains a copy of $\ZZ$, then the subfield of $\FF$ generated by $\iota(\ZZ)$ is isomorphic to $\QQ$. For let's define the injection on generators $$\iota \colon \ZZ \to \FF \quad \text{ such that } 1 \mapsto 1_\FF.$$ Since $\RR$ has characteristic $0$, $\FF$ does too. That is, $\iota$ has trivial kernel $0\ZZ$. We identify $\ZZ \hookrightarrow \FF$. Because the field of fractions $\QQ$ is the smallest field containing $\ZZ$, we must have $\FF \supset \QQ$. \qedsymbol

### [@DF04, number 7.5.5]

\gvn Let $F$ be a field, let $F[[x]]$ be the ring of formal power series in the indeterminate $x$ with coefficients in $F$.

\wts 

i. The ring of fractions of $F[[x]]$ is the ring $F((x))$ of formal Laurent series. 
ii. The field of fractions of the power series ring $\ZZ[[x]]$ is *properly* contained in the field of Laurent series $\QQ((x))$ 

\pf

i. (Notation: suppose for $\sum a_n x^n \in F[[x]],$ we define $a_i$ for *all* $i \in \ZZ$ by letting $a_{k} = 0$ when $k < 0$.) Because $F$ is an entire ring, if $\sum a_nx^n, \sum b_nx^n \in F[[x]]\setminus \{0\}$, then $$\sum a_n x^n \sum b_n x^n = \sum_{n\ge 0} \left(\sum_{i+j = n}a_i b_j x^n\right) = \underbrace{ a_k b_\ell  \cdot}_{\text{first nonzero coefficients}} x^{k + \ell} + \sum_{n > k + \ell} \left( \sum_{i+j = n} a_i b_j x^n \right).$$ So $F[[x]]$ is entire, and therefore has a *field* of fractions.

    Now to argue that this field of fractions is $F((x))$. We need to demonstrate for all $\sum a_n x^n \in F[[x]] \setminus \{0\}$, there exists some $(\sum a_n x^n)^{-1} \in F((x))$. So let $k = \min\{n : a_n \neq 0\}$ be the index of $\sum a_nx^n$, and define inductively $$b_{-k} = a_k^{-1} \quad \text{ and } b_{-k+n} = -a_k^{-1}\left(\sum_{\substack{i+j = n \\ k <j}} a_j b_j\right) \quad \text{ for all $n \in \NN$}.$$ Then $\left( \sum a_n x^n \right) \left(\sum b_n x^n\right) = \sum_{n \ge 0}\left(\sum_{i+j = n} a_i b_j\right)x^n = 1x^0 + 0x^1 + 0x^2 + \ldots = 1 \in F[[x]].$ Thus $(\sum a_n x^n)^{-1} = \sum b_n x^n$. We've demonstrated that $F((x))$ *contains* the field of fractions of $F[[x]]$. For the opposite containment, note that if $K$ is a field containing $F[[x]]$, then $x, x^{-1} \in K$, and by linearity $F((x)) \subset K$. We conclude that the field of formal Laurent series $F((x))$ is the smallest field containing the ring of formal power series $F[[x]]$, so $F((x))$ is the field of fractions of $F[[x]]$.

ii. To show $\QQ((x))$ properly contains $F := \text{ the field of fractions of } \ZZ[[x]]$, consider $e^x \in \QQ((x))$. Suppose $e^x \in F$ for contradiction. There then must be integer power series $a'(x), b'(x) \in \ZZ[[x]]$ to clear the denominators of $e^x$, i.e., such that $a'(x)e^x = b'(x)$. Choose $a(x) \in \ZZ[[x]]$ of minimal index $I(a) = \min\{n : a_n \neq 0\}$ such that there exists $b(x) \in \ZZ[[x]]$ with $$a(x)e^x = b(x).$$ Explicitly, that's $$\left(\sum_{n \ge I(a)} a_n x^n\right)\left(\sum_{n\ge 0} \frac{x^n}{n!}\right) = \left(\sum_{n \ge 0} b_n x^n\right).$$ Hence $$\sum_{n \ge I(a)}\left( \sum_{i+j =n } \frac{a_i}{j!}\right) = \sum_{n \ge 0} b_n x^n.$$ So for all $n \ge I(a)$, $$\left( \sum_{i+j =n } \frac{a_i}{j!}\right) - b_n =0,$$ or, again for all $n \ge I(a)$, clearing denominators, $$\frac{a_{I(a)}}{n-I(a)} + \underbrace{\ldots + a_n(n - (I(a) + 1))! - b_n(n - I(a))!}_{\text{ all integers }} = 0.$$ We observe that $a_{I(a)}$ is divisible by all natural numbers, which forces $a_{I(a)} = 0$, contradicting the choice of $a(x) = \sum_{n \ge I(a)} a_n x^n$ with minimal index. \qedsymbol

### [@DF04, number 7.6.1]

\gvn An element $e \in R$ is called *idempotent* if $e^2 = e$. Assume $e$ is idempotent in $R$ and $er =re$ for all $r \in R$. 

\wts 

i. $Re$ and $R(1-e)$ are two-sided ideals of $R$.
i. $Re \times R(1-e) \cong R$ as rings.
i. $e$ and $1-e$ are identities for the subrings $Re$ and $R(1-e)$ respectively.

\pf 

i. Let $re,se \in Re$ and $r(1-e), s(1-e) \in R(1-e)$ be arbitrary elements. Then $$re - se = (r-s)e \in Re, \quad \text{ and } \quad r(1-e) - s(1-e) = (r-s)(1-e) \in R(1-e).$$ For any $t \in R$, we have also $$tre \in Re, \quad \text{ and } \quad ret = rte \in Re$$ and $$tr(1-e) \in R(1-e), \quad\text{ and } \quad  r(1-e)t = rt - ret = rt - rte = rt(1-e) \in R(1-e).$$

ii. Consider that $Re + R(1-e) \ni e + 1 - e = 1$. Moreover, $Re \cap R(1-e) \ni a$ implies $a = re$ and $a = s - se$, so $re = s-se$ hence $(r+s)e = s$ hence $(r+s)e^2 = se$ hence $re + se= se$ hence $se = 0$. So $a=0$. We conclude the ideals $Re$ and $R(1-e)$ are comaximal with trivial intersection. By [@DF04, section 5.4], we recognize $R \cong Re \times R(1-e)$ as additive groups. Now we take the associated isomorphism of groups $\phi \colon R \to Re \times R(1-e)$ and check that $\phi$ is also ring homomorphism (an isomorphism actually, as the kernel is still trivial). We verify multiplicativity: $$\phi(re + s(1-e))\phi(te + v(1-e)) = \phi(rte, sv(1-2e + e^2)) = \phi(rte + sv(1-e)).$$ 

iii. Consider the coordinate subrings $Re$ and $R(1-e)$. If $re \in Re$, then $ere = re^2  = re = ree$, so $e$ is the identity of $Re$. Likewise, if $r(1-e) \in R(1-e)$, then $(1-e)r(1-e) = r - re - er + ere = r(1-e)$. Similarly, $r(1-e)^2 = r(1-2e + e^2) = r(1-e)$. So $1-e$ is the identity for $R(1-e)$. \qedsymbol

### [@DF04, number 7.6.6]

\gvn Let $f_1(x), f_2(x), \ldots, f_k(x)$ be polynomials with integer coefficients of the same degree $d$. Let $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k$ be integers which are relatively prime in pairs ($\gcd(n_i, n_j) = 1$ for all $i \neq j$). 

\wts 

i. There exists a polynomial $f(x)$ with integer coefficients and of degree $d$ with $f(x) \equiv f_1(x) \pmod{n_1}$, $f(x) \equiv f_2(x) \pmod{n_2}$, ..., $f(x) \equiv f_k(x) \pmod{n_k}$, i.e., the coefficients of $f(x)$ agree with the coefficients of $f_i(x) \pmod{n_i}$. 
ii. If all the $f_i(x)$ are monic, then $f(x)$ may also be chosen monic.

\pf 

i. Because in $\ZZ$ the ideals $n_i\ZZ$ are pairwise comaximal, in $\ZZ[x]$ the ideals $n_i\ZZ[x]$ are also pairwise comaximal. (Observe for a ring $R$ and ideals $\fa, \fb \subset R$, it's true that $(\fa + \fb)[x] = \fa[x] + \fb[x]$, for $\sum (a_n + b_n) x^n = \sum a_nx^n + \sum b_n x^n$.) By the CRT, $$\phi \colon \ZZ[x] \to \prod_1^k \ZZ[x] / n_i\ZZ[x]$$ is surjective. In lecture, we proved $\ZZ[x] / n_i\ZZ[x] \cong (\ZZ/n_i\ZZ) [x]$. That $\phi$ is surjective implies: $$\text{there exists } f \in \ZZ[x] \text{ with } f(x) \equiv f_i(x) \pmod{n_i} \text{ for all }i = 1, \ldots, k.$$

ii. Suppose the $f_i$ are each monic. Why can $f$ be chosen monic? Well, if the $f_i$ are monic, the leading coefficient $a_{\ell_i} \equiv 1 \pmod{n_i}$ of each $f_i$. By the CRT, the system of congruences $a_\ell \equiv a_{\ell_i} \pmod{n_i}$ has integral solutions uniquely determined modulo $n = \prod n_i$. One such solution is $a_\ell = 1 \equiv  1 \pmod{n_i}$ (for all $i$), which corresponds to $f(x)$ with a leading coefficient $a_\ell =1$. (Note in this case the degree of $f$ does not change, only the leading coefficient.) \qedsymbol

### [@DF04, number 8.1.3]

\gvn Let $R$ be a Euclidean Domain. Let $m$ be the minimum integer in the set of norms of nonzero elements of $R$. 

\wts Every nonzero element of $R$ of norm $m$ is a unit. Therefore, a nonzero element of norm zero (if such and element exists) is a unit.

\pf Consider nonzero $a \in R$ of minimum norm. Now $R$ is a nonzero ideal in itself, so that $R = (d)$ where $d$ is any nonzero element of minimum norm in $R$ [@DF04, section 8.1]. But $(d) = R$ if and only if $d$ is a unit. Since $a$ is of minimum norm, $(a) = R$ and thus $a$ is a unit. We deduce that for any nonzero $b \in R$ with $N(b) = 0$, it's clear that $b$ would be of minimum norm among nonzero elements of $R$, whence $b$ would be a unit. \qedsymbol

### [@DF04, number 8.1.7]

*To find.* Generators for the following ideals in $\ZZ[i]$

- $(85, 1+13i)$,
- $(47 - 13i, 53+56i)$.

*Demonstration.* (We implement the extended Euclidean algorithm for the Gaussian integers.)

We have $(85, 1+13i) = (7+6i)$, observing 

```
85      = -6i * (1 + 13i) + (7 + 6i)
1 + 13i = (1 + i) * (7 + 6i)
```

as well, we have $(47 - 13i, 53+56i) = (4 - 5i)$, 

```
53 + 56i = (1 + i) * (47 - 13i) + (-7 + 22i)
47 - 13i = (-1 - 2i) * (-7 + 22i) + (4 - 5i)
-7 + 22i = (-2 - 3i) * (4 - 5i)
```
and in the PID $\ZZ[i]$, a gcd of a finite set of elements generates the smallest ideal containing that set of elements. \qedsymbol

### [@DF04, number 8.2.6]

\gvn Let $R$ be an entire ring and suppose that every *prime* ideal in $R$ is principal. 

\wts We'll prove that every ideal of $R$ is principal in the following fashion:

a. Let $\sS$ be the set of ideals of $R$ that are not principal is nonempty. Assuming $\sS \neq \emptyset$,  $\sS$ has a maximal element under inclusion (which, by hypothesis, is not prime).

b. Let $\fm$ be an ideal which is maximal with respect to being nonprincipal, and let $a, b \in R$ with $ab \in \fm$ but $a \notin \fm$ and $b \notin \fm$. Let $\fa = (\fm, a)$ be the ideal generated by $\fm$ and $a$, let $\fb = (\fm, b)$ be the ideal generated by $\fm$ and $b$, and define $\fq = \{ r \in R : r\fa \subset \fm\}$. Then $\fa = (\alpha)$ and $\fb = (\beta)$ are principal ideals in $R$ with $\fm \subsetneq \fb \subset \fq$ and $\fa\fq \subset \fm$.

c. If $x \in \fm$, then $x = s\alpha$ for some $s \in \fq$, forcing a contradiction: $\fm \subsetneq \fb \subset \fq \subset \fm$. Therefore $\sS$ must have been empty, whence $R$ is a PID.

\pf

a. Let $\sS$ be a poset of ideals ordered by inclusion, as above. Assume $\sS \neq \emptyset$. Consider a chain of ideals $(\fa_0, \fa_1, \fa_2,\ldots)$ in $\sS$. Let $\bar\fa = \cup_{n \ge 0} \fa_i$. If $\bar\fa$ is not in $\sS$, then $\bar\fa = (a)$ for some $a \in R$. But then $a \in \fa_n$ for some $n$, hence $\fa_n \subset \bar\fa \subset \fa_n$, forcing $\fa_n$ to be principal. So $\bar\fa \in \sS$ is a bound for the chain of ideals $(\fa_0, \fa_1, \ldots)$. By Zorn's lemma, a partially ordered set where every chain is bounded above has a maximal element. So $\sS$ has a maximal element, call it the ideal $\fm$.

b. Suppose $ab \in \fm$ with $a \notin \fm$ and $b \notin \fm$. Let $\fq = \{ r \in R : r\fa \subset \fm\}$, where $\fa = (\fm, a)$ and $\fb = (\fm, b)$. Since $\fa$ and $\fb$ are not in $\sS$, we have $\fa = (\alpha)$ and $\fb = (\beta)$ for some $\alpha, \beta \in R$.

    - Is $\fq$ an ideal? Yes, for with $r,s \in \fq$, both $(r+s) \fa = r\fa + s\fa \subset \fm$ and so too $(rs)\fa = r (s\fa) \subset r\fm \subset \fm$.
    - Does $\fq$ contain $\fb$? Yes. Multiplying generators, $\fa \fb = (\fm, a)(\fm,b) = (\fm^2, \fm b, \fm a, ab) \subset \fm$ as $ab \in \fm$. So if $r\beta \in \fb$, then $r\beta \fa \subset \fm$. 
    - We conclude $\fm \subsetneq \fb \subset \fq$ as $\fm$ is maximal among nonprincipal ideals, and is thus properly contained in $\fb$.

   Commutativity and the definition of $\fq$ implies $\fa\fq = \fq \fa \subset \fm$.

c. Now to argue for contradiction. Say $x \in \fm$. Then $x = s\alpha$ for some $s \in R$. But $s\fa = s(\alpha) = (x)$, so $(x) \subset \fm$ implies $s\fa \subset \fm$, forcing $x \in \fq$. Thus $\fm \subsetneq \fb \subset \fq \subset \fm$, which is absurd. \qedsymbol

### [@DF04, number 8.2.7]

\gvn An entire ring $R$ in which every ideal generated by two elements is principal (i.e., for every $a, b \in R$, $(a,b) = (d)$ for some $d \in R$) is called a *Bézout Domain.*

\wts

a. An entire ring $R$ is a Bézout Domain if and only if every pair of elements $a, b$ of $R$ has a g.c.d. $d$ in $R$ that can be written as an $R$-linear combination of $a$ and $b$. (That is, $d = ax + by$ for some $x,y \in R$.)

b. Every finitely generated ideal of a Bézout Domain is principal.

c. Let $F$ be the fraction field of the Bézout Domain $R$. Every element of $F$ can be written in the form $a/b$ with $a, b \in R$ and $a$ relatively prime to $b$.

\pf

a. In one direction, say $R$ is a Bézout domain. Then $(a,b) = (d)$ for any two elements $a,b \in R$. Then $d \in (a,b)$, and is of the form $d = ra + sb$ for some $r,s \in R$. Now $(d) \supset (a)$ and $(d) \supset (b)$. With any other divisor $(d') \supset (a)$ and $(d') \supset (b)$, we'd have $(d') \cap (a,b) = (d)$. So $d$ is a gcd of $a$ and $b$.

    Conversely suppose any two elements $a,b \in R$ have a gcd $d$ that can be written as a $R$-linear combination $ra + sb = d$ for some $r,s \in R$. Then consider $(a,b)$, the least ideal containing $\{a,b\}$. Let $\fm$ be another ideal containing $\{a,b\}$. Clearly $(a,b) \subset \fm$. Since $d = ra + sb$, we have also $(d) \subset \fm$. Moreover, $(d) \supset (a)$ and $(d) \supset (b)$, as $d$ is a common divisor.^[TODO: revise.] So $(d)$ is the smallest ideal containing $(a,b)$, hence $(d) = (a,b)$.

b. We proceed by induction on the size $n$ of the finite generating set $X_n$ of elements of $R$. Say $X_2$ is done for a base case (we're in a Bézout domain). Now suppose every ideal generated by $X_{n-1}$ is principal. Consider $(X_n)$. But this ideal is just $(X_{n-1}, r_n)$ for $r_i \in X_n$. By the inductive hypothesis, $(X_{n-1}) = (d)$, so $(X_n) = (d, r_n)$.  Being in a Bézout domain, $(d, r_n) = (\delta)$ for some $\delta \in R$, completing the induction.

c. We know an element of $F$ is of the form $rs^{-1}$ for $r \in R$ and $s \in R\setminus\{0\}$. Consider $d \in \mathrm{GCD}(r,s)$. We know both $(r,s) = (d)$ and there exist $x,y \in R$ such that $rx + sy = d$ (perhaps multiplying through by a unit). Since $r \in (d)$ and $s \in (d)$, we can write $r = ad$ and $s = bd$. So the $R$-linear combination becomes $$d = adx + bdy, \quad \text{ or } \quad 1 = ax + by, $$ where $(a,b) = (1)$. Here, $a$ and $b$ are coprime and $\frac{r}{s} = \frac{ad}{bd} = \frac{a}{b}$. \qedsymbol

### [@DF04, number 8.2.8]

\gvn $R$ is a PID and $D$ is a multiplicatively closed subset of $R \setminus \{0\}$.

\wts The ring of fractions $D^{-1}R$ is a PID.

\pf If $R$ is entire, then $R$ has no zero divisors. Consider $\frac{r}{s}, \frac{t}{v} \in D^{-1}R$. If $\frac{rt}{sv} = 0$, then $rt = 0$. Either $r$ or $t$ is $0$ in $R$, whence either $\frac r s$ or $\frac s t$ is $0$ in $D^{-1}R$. To argue that $D^{-1}R$ is a PID, let $\fq$ be an ideal in $D^{-1}R$. Fix $d \in D$. Let $\fp \subset R$ be the ideal defined $$p := \{r \in R: \frac r d \in \fq\}.$$

- Note $\fp$ contains $0$.
- If $\fp$ contains $r$ and $t$, then $\frac r d  + \frac t d = \frac{r + t} d \in \fq$. 
- If $\fp$ contains $r$, then $\frac r d \in \fq$. For any $t \in R$, we'd have $\frac {rt} d \in \fq$.

Because $\fp \subset R$ is a PID, there's $p \in R$ such that $(p) = \fp$. We'll now argue that $\fq \subset D^{-1}R$ is principal, namely that $\fq = (p / d)$. For one containment, let $s^{-1} q \in \fq$. Then $(d^{-1}s)s^{-1}q \in \fq$. So $\frac{q}{d} \in \fq$. Thus $q \in \fp$. We take the multiple $q = tp$ for some $t \in R$. Equating the two expressions of $q$, $$s^{-1}q = s^{-1}tp = s^{-1}dd^{-1}tp = s^{-1}dt \cdot \frac p d \in \left(\frac p d\right).$$ For the other containment, take any $t \in R$, and observe by definition of $\fq$ we have $\frac p d t \in \fq$. Whence $\left(\frac p d\right) = \fq$. We conclude $D^{-1}R$ is a PID. \qedsymbol

### [@DF04, number 8.3.2]

\gvn Let $a$ and $b$ be nonzero elements of the UFD $R$. 

\wts Then $a$ and $b$ have a least common multiple. 

*Demonstration.* We describe a least common multiple of $a$ and $b$ in terms of the prime factorizations of $a$ and $b$:

- Let $\{p_i\}_1^n$ be the set of distinct primes (irreducibles) in the unique factorization of the product $ab$. 
- Choose exponents $\alpha_i, \beta_i \in \ZZ_{\ge 0}$ such that $a = \prod_1^n p_i^{\alpha_i}$ and $b = \prod_1^n p_i^{\beta_i}$.
   - These factorizations are unique up to associates, and we allow for zero exponents.
- Let $e = \prod_1^n p_i^{\max\{\alpha_i, \beta_i\}} \in R$.
- Verify that $e \in (a)$ and $e \in (b)$:
   - $e = \left(\prod_1^n p_i^{\max\{0, \alpha_i- \beta_i\}}\right)a$, similarly
   - $e = \left(\prod_1^n p_i^{\max\{0, \beta_i - \alpha_i\}}\right)b$.
- Suppose $e' = ra$ and $e' = sb$. Consider $ra = sb$. 
   - Now $r$ has a unique prime factorization $$r= \left(\prod_1^n p_i^{\gamma_i}\right)\left(\prod_1^m t_j^{\rho_j}\right)$$ with the $p_i$ as before and the primes $t_j$ distinct from the $p_i$. 
   - Because $ra = sb$, for each $i = 1, \ldots, n$ we must have $\gamma_i \ge \max\{\alpha_i, \beta_i\}$.
   - So then $e' = ra = \left(\prod_1^n p_i^{\alpha_i + \gamma_i}\right)\left(\prod_1^m t_j^{\rho_j}\right)$.
   - Because $\gamma_i + \alpha_i \ge \max\{\alpha_i, \beta_i\}$, we have $e' \in (e)$.

Now we've given an explicit construction of a least common multiple of $a$ and $b$, namely $e \in R$. \qedsymbol

### [@DF04, number 8.3.6]

\gvn We work in the Gaussian integers $\ZZ[i]$.

*To demonstrate.*

a. The quotient ring $\ZZ[i]/(1+i)$ is a field of order $2$.
b. Let $q \in \ZZ$ be a prime with $q \equiv 3\mod 4$. The quotient ring $\ZZ[i]/(q)$ is a field with $q^2$ elements.
c. Let $p \in \ZZ$ be a prime with $p \equiv 1 \mod 4$ and write $p = \pi\bar\pi$ as in Proposition 18. 
    - The hypotheses for the Chinese Remainder Theorem (Theorem 17 in Section 7.6) are satisfied. 
    - Moreover $\ZZ[i]/(p) \cong \ZZ[i]/(\pi) \times \ZZ[i]/(\bar\pi)$ as rings. 
    - The quotient ring $\ZZ[i]/(p)$ has order $p^2$.
    - Therefore, $\ZZ[i]/(\pi)$ and $\ZZ[i]/(\bar\pi)$ are both fields of order $p$.

*Demonstration.*

a. When is $a + bi \in (1+ i)$? Precisely when long division of $a +bi$ by $1+i$ in $\ZZ[i]$ has no remainder, that's exactly when $$\frac{a+bi}{1+i} = \frac{(a - b) + (a+b)i}{2} \in \ZZ[i].$$ That is, $$a-b \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \quad \text{ and } \quad a+b \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \quad \text{ if and only if } \quad a + bi \in (1 + i).$$ It's true for all $a \in \ZZ$ that $2a \equiv 0 \pmod{2}$, so always $(a+b) + (a-b) \equiv 0 \pmod{2}$. This means either both the sum and the difference of $a$ and $b$ is *even*, or both the sum and the difference is *odd*. So $\ZZ[i]/(1+i)$ has only two equivalence classes, and is thus a ring isomorphic to the field $\ZZ/2\ZZ$.

b.  Let $q \in \ZZ$ be prime and $\equiv 3 \pmod{4}$. Then $a + bi \in (q)$ if and only if $\frac{a+bi}{q} \in \ZZ[i]$, if and only if (in $\ZZ$) $a \in (q)$ and $b \in (q)$. The $q^2 - 1$ nontrivial equivalence classes are index by distinct (modulo $q$) solutions $a,b \in \ZZ$ to $a \notin (q)$ or $b \notin(q)$. Because $\ZZ[i]$ is a PID and $(q) \subset \ZZ[i]$, a nonzero prime ideal, we know $(q)$ is maximal. So the quotient $\ZZ[i]/(q)$ is a field, and counting by equivalence classes, $\ZZ[i]/(q)$ has $q^2$ elements.

c. Let $p \in \ZZ$ be prime, $\equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ and consider $a, b \in \ZZ$ such that $p = [a+bi]*[a-bi]$.

   That $\ZZ[i](p)$ is a field of order $p^2$ follows from part b. Now consider the ideals $(a+bi)$ and $(a-bi$. Observe $p, 2a \in (a+bi) + (a - bi)$, where $p = (a+bi)(0 + a-bi)$. Since $p > a^2$ and $p \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$, $p \notin (2a)$. We see $p$ and $2a$ are coprime (in the Gaussian integers). Thus $\ZZ[i] = (p, 2a) \subset (a + bi) + (a - bi)$ are comaximal ideals. Moreover $(p) = (a+bi) \cap (a-bi)$ (verify). The CRT implies $\ZZ[i]/(p) \cong \ZZ[i]/(a+bi) \times \ZZ[i]/(a - bi).$ Because neither coordinate subring is trivial, their orders must both be $p$. \qedsymbol

\wts $R$ is a PID if and only if $R$ is a UFD that is also a Bézout Domain.

\pf \fore If $R$ is a PID, then each element of $R$ has a unique factorization into irreducibles [@DF04, section 8.3] and each ideal of $R$ is principal. So $R$ would be a Bézout UFD 

\back Say $R$ is a Bézout UFD. Let $\fa$ be an ideal in $R$. We aim to show $\fa$ is principal. Choose $a \in \fa$ such that $a = r_1 \cdots r-n$ has the minimum number of irreducible factors among elements of $\fa$. Suppose $b \in \fa \setminus (a)$ for contradiction. Say $R$ is Bézout, so $\mathrm{GCD}(a,b) \ni d$, and $(d) = (a,b)$. Note $b$ has $s_1 \cdots s_m$ irreducible factors with $m > n$. So $a \notin (b)$. As well, we assume $b \notin (a)$, so together this implies $d \neq b$. One should verify $d \neq b$ implies $(d) \supsetneq (a)$. We conclude $d$ has fewer irreducible factors than $a$. But $d \in (a,b) \subset \fa$, which is absurd! We've discovered that $\fa \setminus (a)$ is empty, which forces $\fa \subset (a) \subset \fa$. Therefore $\fa$ is principal and $R$ is a PID. \qedsymbol
