### [@DF04, number 4.5.16]

Let $\abs{G} = pqr$ where $p$, $q$ and $r$ are primes with $p < q < r$. Then $G$ has a normal Sylow subgroup for either $p$, $q$ or $r$.

### [@DF04, number 4.5.26]

Let $G$ be a group of order $105$. If a Sylow $3$-subgroup of $G$ is normal, then $G$ is abelian.

### [@DF04, number 4.5.30]

How many elements of order $7$ must there be in a simple group of order $168$?

### [@DF04, number 4.5.32]

Let $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup and let $H$ be a subgroup of $K$. If $P \triangleleft H$ and $H \triangleleft K$, then $P$ is normal in $K$. Therefore, if $P \in \Syl p G$ and $H = \N G P$, then $\N G P = H$.

### [@DF04, number 4.5.35] 

Let $P \in \Syl p G$ and let $H \le G$. We have that $gPg^{-1} \cap H$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $H$ for some $g \in G$. We exhibit that $hPh^{-1} \cap H$ is not necessarily a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $H$ for any $h \in H$. (In particular, we cannot always take $g = 1$ in the first part of the problem, as we could when $H$ was normal in $G$.)

### [@DF04, number 4.5.44]

Let $p$ be the smallest prime dividing the order of the finite group $G$. If $P \in \Syl p G$ and $P$ is cyclic, then $\N G P = \C G P$.

### [@DF04, number 4.6.4]

$A_n$ is generated by the set of all $3$-cycles for each $n \ge 3$.

### [@DF04, number 5.1.4]

Let $A$ and $B$ be finite groups and let $p$ be a prime. Any Sylow $p$-subgroup of $A \times B$ is of the form $P \times Q$, where $P \in \Syl p A$ and $Q \in \Syl p B$. Therefore $n_p(A \times B) = n_p(A)n_p(B)$. We generalize both of these results to a direct product of any finite number of finite groups (so that the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of a direct product is the product of the numbers of Sylow $p$-subgroups of the factors).

### [@DF04, number 5.4.15]

If $A$ and $B$ are normal subgroups of $G$ such that $G/A$ and $G/B$ are both abelian, then $G / (A \cap B)$ is abelian.

### [@DF04, number 5.4.19]

A group $H$ is called perfect if $H' = H$ (i.e., if $H$ is its own commutator subgroup).

(a) Every non-abelian simple group is perfect.
(b) If $H$ and $K$ are perfect subgroups of a group $G$, then $\langle H, K \rangle$ is also perfect. Thence the subgroup of $G$ generated by any collection of perfect subgroups is perfect.
(c) Any conjugate of a perfect subgroup is perfect.
(d) Any group $G$ has a unique maximal perfect subgroup, and moreover, this subgroup is normal.

### [@DF04, number 5.5.12]

We classify the groups of order 20 (into five isomorphism types).

### [@DF04, number 5.5.18]

If $H$ is any group then there's a group $G$ that contains $H$ as a normal subgroup with the property that for every automorphism $\sigma$ of $H$ there is an element $g \in G$ such that conjugatation by $g$ when restricted to $H$ is the given automorphism $\sigma$. That is, every automorphism of $H$ is obtained as an inner automorphism of $G$ restricted to $H$.

### [@DF04, number 5.5.23]

Let $K$ and $L$ be groups, let $n$ be a positive integer, let $\rho \colon K \to S_n$ be a homomorphism and let $H$ be the direct product of $n$ copies of $L$. From [@DF04, number 5.1.8], we constructed an injective homomorphism $\psi$ from $S_n$ into $\Aut{H}$ by letting the elements of $S_n$ permute the $n$ factors of $H$. The compositions $\psi \circ \rho$ is a homomorphism from $G$ into $\Aut{H}$. The *wreath product* of $L$ by $K$ is the semidirect product $H \rtimes_\psi K$ with respect to this homomorphism and is denoted by $L \wr K$. Note this wreath product depends on the choice of permutation representation $\rho$ of $K$ --- if none is given explicitly, then $\phi$ is assumed to be the left regular representation of $K$.

(a) Assume $K$ and $L$ are finite groups and $\rho$ is the left regular representation of $K$. We find $\abs{L \wr K}$ in terms of $\abs{K}$ and $\abs{L}$.

(b) Let $p$ be a prime, let $K = L = Z_p$. Suppose $\rho$ is the left regular representation of $K$. Then $Z_p \wr Z_p$ is a non-abelian subgroup of order $p^{p+1}$ and is isomorphic to a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $S_{p^2}$. [The $p$ copies of $Z_p$ whose direct products makes up $H$ may be represented by $p$ disjoint $p$-cycles; these are cyclically permuted by $K$.]
