### [@DF04, number 3.5.13]

Every element of order $2$ in $A_n$ is the square of an element of order $4$ is $S_n$. An element of order $2$ in $A_n$ is a product of $2k$ commuting transpositions.

### [@DF04, number 3.5.15]

If $x$ and $y$ are distinct $3$-cycles in $S_4$ with $x \neq y^{-1}$, then the subgroup of $S_4$ generated by $x$ and $y$ is $A_4$.

### [@DF04, number 4.2.8]

If $H$ has finite index $n$ then there is a normal subgroup $K$ of $G$ with $K \le H$ and $\abs{G : K} \le n!$.

### [@DF04, number 4.3.13]

We exhaustively list all finite groups that have exactly two conjugacy classes.

### [@DF04, number 4.3.19]

Assume $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, $\sK$ is a conjugacy class of $G$ contained in $H$ and $x \in \sK$. We show $\sK$ is a union of $k$ conjugacy classes of equal size in $H$, where $k = \abs{G : HC_G(x)}$. We then show^[Letting $A = C_G(x)$ and $B = H$ so $A \cap B = C_H(x)$, drawing the lattice diagram associated to the second isomorphism theorem, and interpreting the appropriate indices.] a conjugacy class in $S_n$ that consists of even permutations is either a single conjugacy class under the action of $A_n$ or is a union of two classes of the same size in $A_n$. 

### [@DF04, number 4.3.23]

If $M$ is a maximal subgroup of $G$ then either $N_G(M) = M$ or $N_G(M) = G$. Therefore, if $M$ is a maximal subgroup of $G$ that is not normal in $G$ then the number of nonidentity elements of $G$ that are contained in conjugates of $M$ is at most $(\abs{M} -1)\cdot \abs{G:M}$.

### [@DF04, number 4.3.24]

Assume $H$ is a proper subgroup of the finite group $G$. Then $G$ is not the union of the conjugates of any proper subgroup,^[Hint: put $H$ in some maximal subgroup and use the previous exercise.] i.e., $$G \neq \bigcup_{g \in G} gHg^{-1}.$$

### The size of each conjugacy class in $S_n$ [@DF04, number 4.3.33]

Let $\sigma$ be a permutation in $S_n$ and let $m_1, \ldots, m_s$ be *distinct* integers that appear in the cycle type of $\sigma$ (including $1$-cycles). For each $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, s\}$ assume $\sigma$ has $k_i$ cycles of length $m_i$ (so that $\sum_{i=1}^s k_i m_i = n$). Then the number of conjugates^[If $n \ge m$ then the number of $m$-cycles in $S_n$ is given by $$\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\ldots(n-m+1)}{m}.$$ For another example, if $n \ge 4$ then the number of permutations in $S_n$ that are the product of two disjoint $2$-cycles is $n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)/8$.] of $\sigma$ is $$\frac{n!}{(k_1!m_1^{k_1})(k_2!m_2^{k_2})\cdots(k_s!m_s^{k_s})}.$$

### [@DF04, number 4.4.3]

Under any automorphism of $D_8$, $r$ has at most $2$ possible images and $s$ has at most $4$ possible images. Thence $\abs{\Aut{(D_8)}} \le 8$.

### [@DF04, number 4.4.8]

Suppose $G$ is a group with subgroups $H$ and $K$ where $H \le K$.

(a) If $H$ is characteristic in $K$ and $K$ is normal in $G$, then $H$ is normal in $G$. (*optional*)
(b) If $H$ is characteristic in $K$ and $K$ is characteristic in $G$, then $H$ is characteristic in $G$. Thence the *Viergruppe* $V_4$ is characteristic in $S_4$.
(c) If $H$ is normal in $K$ and $K$ is characteristic in $G$, then $H$ need not be normal in $G$.

### [@DF04, number 4.4.18]

For $n \neq 6$ every automorphism of $S_n$ is inner. Fix an integer $n \ge 2$ with $n \neq 6$.

(a) The automorphism group of a group $G$ permutes the conjugacy classes of $G$, i.e., for each $\sigma \in \Aut{G}$ and each conjugacy class $\sK$ of $G$ the set $\sigma(\sK)$ is also a conjugacy class of $G$.
(b) Let $\sK$ be the conjugacy class of transpositions in $S_n$ and let $\sK'$ be the conjugacy class of any element of order $2$ in $S_n$ that is not a transposition. Then $\abs{\sK} \neq \abs{\sK'}$. Furthermore, any automorphism of $S_n$ sends transpositions to transpositions. 
(c) For each $\sigma \in \Aut{S_n}$ we have $$\sigma \colon (1\, 2) \mapsto (a\, b_2), \quad\quad \sigma \colon (1\, 3) \mapsto (a\, b_3), \quad\ldots, \quad \sigma \colon (1\, n) \mapsto (a\, b_n)$$ for some distinct integers $a, b_2, b_3, \ldots, b_n \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$.
(d) Therefore $(1\, 2), (1\, 3), \ldots, (1\, n)$ generate $S_n$. Furthermore $S_n$ is uniquely determined by its action on these elements. Then by (c), $S_n$ has at *most* $n!$ automorphisms. We conclude that $\Aut{S_n} = \mathrm{Inn}(S_n)$ for $n \neq 6$.

### [@DF04, number 4.4.20]

For any finite group $P$, let $d(P)$ be the minimum^[For example, $d(P) = 1$ if and only if $P$ is a nontrivial cyclic group and $d(Q_8) = 2$.] number of generators of $P$. Let $m(P)$ be the maximum of the integers $d(A)$ as $A$ runs^[For example, $m(Q_8) = 1$ and $m(D_8) = 2$.] over all *abelian* subgroups of $P$. Define the *Thompson subgroup* of $P$ as $$J(P) = \langle A : A \text{ is an abelian subgroup of $P$ with } d(A) = m(P)\rangle.$$

(a) $J(P)$ is a characteristic subgroup of $P$.
(b) For each of the following groups $P$, we exhaustively list all abelian subgroups $A$ of $P$ that satisfy $d(A) = m(P)$.

- $Q_8$
- $D_8$
- $D_{16}$
- $QD_{16}$ (the quasidihedral group of order $16$)
