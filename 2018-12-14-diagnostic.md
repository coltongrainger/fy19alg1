i. Show that the cyclic group of order $6$ is the group defined by the generators $a,b$ and the relations $a^2 = b^2 = a^{-1}b^{-1}ab = e$.
i. Prove that $G = \langle x, y : x^3 = y^3 = (xy)^3 = 1\rangle$ is an infinite group as follows. 

    Let $p$ be a prime congruent to $1 \mod 3$ and let $G_p$ be the non-abelian group of order $3p$. Let $a,b \in G_p$ with $\abs{a} = p$ and $\abs{b} = 3$. [@DF04, number 6.3.14] Verify that both $ab$ and $ab^2$ have order $3$. Show that $G_p$ is a homomorphic image of $G$. Argue that $G$ is therefore an infinite group, as there are infinitely many primes $p \equiv 1 \mod 3$.

### Semi-direct products

i. Let $K$ and $L$ be groups, let $n$ be a positive integer, let $\rho \colon K \to S_n$ be a homomorphism and let $H$ be the direct product of $n$ copies of $L$. From [@DF04, number 5.1.8], we constructed an injective homomorphism $\psi$ from $S_n$ into $\Aut{H}$ by letting the elements of $S_n$ permute the $n$ factors of $H$. The compositions $\psi \circ \rho$ is a homomorphism from $G$ into $\Aut{H}$. The *wreath product* of $L$ by $K$ is the semidirect product $H \rtimes_\psi K$ with respect to this homomorphism and is denoted by $L \wr K$. Note this wreath product depends on the choice of permutation representation $\rho$ of $K$ --- if none is given explicitly, then $\phi$ is assumed to be the left regular representation of $K$. [@DF04, number 5.5.23]

    (a) Assume $K$ and $L$ are finite groups and $\rho$ is the left regular representation of $K$. We find $\abs{L \wr K}$ in terms of $\abs{K}$ and $\abs{L}$.

    (b) Let $p$ be a prime, let $K = L = Z_p$. Suppose $\rho$ is the left regular representation of $K$. Then $Z_p \wr Z_p$ is a non-abelian subgroup of order $p^{p+1}$ and is isomorphic to a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $S_{p^2}$. [The $p$ copies of $Z_p$ whose direct products makes up $H$ may be represented by $p$ disjoint $p$-cycles; these are cyclically permuted by $K$.]

i. Classify the thirteen isomorphism types of groups of order $56$. *See.* [@DF04, number 5.5.7] 

### Frattini's argument [@DF04, number 6.1.20]

i. State Frattini's argument.
i. Let $p$ be a prime, let $P$ be a $p$-subgroup of the finite group $G$, let $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$ whose order is relatively prime to $p$, and let $\bar{G} = G/N$. 

    a. With Frattini's argument, $\N { \bar{G} } { \bar{P} } = \overline{\N G P}$.
    b. From above, $\N{\bar{G}}{\bar{P}} = \overline{\N G P}$.
