### [@DF04, number 7.5.4]

Any subfield of $\RR$ must contain $\QQ$.

### [@DF04, number 7.5.5]

If $F$ is a field, the field of fractions of $F[[x]]$ (the ring of formal power series in the indeterminate $x$ with coefficients in $F$) is the ring $F((x))$ of formal Laurent series. The field of fractions of the power series ring $\ZZ[[x]]$ is *properly* contained in the field of Laurent series $\QQ((x))$ (hint: consider the series for $e^x$).

### [@DF04, number 7.6.1]

An element $e \in R$ is called *idempotent* if $e^2 = e$. Assume $e$ is idempotent in $R$ and $er =re$ for all $r \in R$. $Re$ and $R(1-e)$ are two-sided ideals of $R$. $e$ and $1-e$ are identities for the subrings $Re$ and $R(1-e)$ respectively.

### [@DF04, number 7.6.6]

Let $f_1(x), f_2(x), \ldots, f_k(x)$ be polynomials with integer coefficients of the same degree $d$. Let $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k$ be integers which are relatively prime in pairs ($\gcd(n_i, n_j) = 1$ for all $i \neq j$). There exists a polynomial $f(x)$ with integer coefficients and of degree $d$ with $f(x) \equiv f_1(x) \pmod{n_1}$, $f(x) \equiv f_2(x) \pmod{n_2}$, ..., $f(x) \equiv f_k(x) \pmod{n_k}$, i.e., the coefficients of $f(x)$ agree with the coefficients of $f_i(x) \pmod{n_i}$. If all the $f_i(x)$ are monic, then $f(x)$ may also be chosen monic. [Hint: apply the CRT in $\ZZ$ to each of the coefficients separately.]

### [@DF04, number 8.1.3]

Let $R$ be a Euclidean Domain. Let $m$ be the minimum integer in the set of norms of nonzero elements of $R$. Every nonzero element of $R$ of norm $m$ is a unit. Therefore, a nonzero element of norm zero (if such and element exists) is a unit.

### [@DF04, number 8.1.7]

We find a generator for the ideal $(85, 1+13i)$ in $\ZZ[i]$, i.e., the greatest common divisor for $85$ and $1+13i$. We find a generator for the ideal $(47 - 13i, 53+56i)$ as well. [Hint: use the Euclidean algorithm.]

### [@DF04, number 8.2.6]

Let $R$ be an entire ring and suppose that every *prime* ideal in $R$ is principal. (We'll prove that every ideal of $R$ is principal.)

(a) Assume that the set of ideals of $R$ that are not principal is nonempty. This set has a maximal element under inclusion (which, by hypothesis, is not prime). [Hint: use Zorn's Lemma.]

(b) Let $\fm$ be an ideal which is maximal with respect to being nonprincipal, and let $a, b \in R$ with $ab \in \fm$ but $a \notin \fm$ and $b \notin \fm$. Let $\fa = (\fm, a)$ be the ideal generated by $\fm$ and $a$, let $\fb = (\fm, b)$ be the ideal generated by $\fm$ and $b$, and define $\fq = \{ r \in R : r\fa \subset \fm\}$. Then $\fa = (\alpha)$ and $\fb = (\beta)$ are principal ideals in $R$ with $\fm \subsetneq \fb \subset \fq$ and $\fa\fq = (\alpha \beta) \subset \fm$.

(c) If $x \in \fm$, then $x = s\alpha$ for some $s \in \fq$. So $\fm = \fm_a \fq$ is principal, a contradiction. Therefore $R$ is a PID.

### [@DF04, number 8.2.7]

An entire ring $R$ in which every ideal generated by two elements is principal (i.e., for every $a, b \in R$, $(a,b) = (d)$ for some $d \in R$) is called a *Bezout Domain.*^[See also [@DF04, number 8.3.11].]

(a) An entire ring $R$ is a Bezout Domain if and only if every pair of elements $a, b$ of $R$ has a g.c.d. $d$ in $R$ that can be written as an $R$-linear combination of $a$ and $b$. (That is, $d = ax + by$ for some $x,y \in R$.)

(b) Every finitely generated ideal of a Bezout Domain is principal.^[See also [@DF04, section 9.2] and [@DF04, section 9.3] in which not every ideal is principal.]

(c) Let $F$ be the fraction field of the Bezout Domain $R$. Every element of $F$ can be written^[See also [@DF04, number 8.2.1]] in the form $a/b$ with $a, b \in R$ and $a$ relatively prime to $b$.

### [@DF04, number 8.2.8]

If $R$ is a PID and $D$ is a multiplicatively closed subset of $R$, then $D^{-1}R$ is also a PID.^[See also [@DF04, section 7.5].]

### [@DF04, number 8.3.2]

Let $a$ and $b$ be nonzero elements of the UFD $R$. Then $a$ and $b$ have a least common multiple.^[See also [@DF04, number 8.1.11].] We describe a least common multiple of $a$ and $b$ in terms of the prime factorizations of $a$ and $b$.

### [@DF04, number 8.3.6]

(a) The quotient ring $\ZZ[i]/(1+i)$ is a field of order $2$.
(b) Let $q \in \ZZ$ be a prime with $q \equiv 3\mod 4$. The quotient ring $\ZZ[i]/(q)$ is a field with $q^2$ elements.
(c) Let $p \in \ZZ$ be a prime with $p \equiv 1 \mod 4$ and write $p = \pi\bar\pi$ as in Proposition 18. 
    - The hypotheses for the Chinese Remainder Theorem (Theorem 17 in Section 7.6) are satisfied. 
    - Moreover $\ZZ[i]/(p) \cong \ZZ[i]/(\pi) \times \ZZ[i]/(\bar\pi)$ as rings. 
    - The quotient ring $\ZZ[i]/(p)$ has order $p^2$.
    - Therefore, $\ZZ[i]/(\pi)$ and $\ZZ[i]/(\bar\pi)$ are both fields of order $p$.

### Characterization of PIDs [@DF04, number 8.3.11]

$R$ is a PID if and only if $R$ is a UFD that is also a Bezout Domain.^[One direction is given by Theorem 14. For the converse, let $a$ be a nonzero element of the ideal
$\fa$ with a minimum number of irreducible factors. Then prove $\fa = (a)$ by showing if there's an element $b \in \fa$ that's not in $(a)$, then $(a,b) = (d)$ leads to a contradiction.]
