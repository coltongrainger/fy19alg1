### Ravi Vakil

These are materials from [Ravi Vakil's Math 120: Groups and Rings](http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/14-120/).

Here's the early semester syllabus.

- Tues. Sept. 23: welcome; definition of group; isomorphism of groups. Words you should know: binary operation, associative, commutative, group, abelian, identity, inverse, group operation, cyclic group, symmetric (or permutation) group. You defined group homomorphism and isomorphism.
- Thurs. Sept. 25: Examples of groups, including symmetric groups (even infinite ones), matrix groups (linear algebra and group theory), field (e.g. integers mod p). Subgroups. Group actions.
- Sun. Sept. 28: Read up to chapter 2 by now (including the preliminaries chapter). You should know everything in Chapter 1 well except for the generators and relations section of 1.2 (which you should still read). You should try to digest chapter 2, and tell me (on the online assignment) which parts are the hardest to digest.
- Tues. Sept. 30: Isomorphisms. (Sub)groups geneated by a set. Cyclic (sub)groups, finitely generated subgroups. Subgroups of Z/n? Group actions. Examples, including group action on g. Center, centralizer, normalizer, stabilizer.
- Thurs. Oct. 2: stabilizer, kernel, faithful. The information of a group action by G on a set A is the same as maps from G to S_A. Cosets of a subgroup. They "tile" the group. Lagrange's Theorem (if H is a subgroup of a finite group G, then |H| (the size=order of H) is a factor of |G|). The order of every element of G divides |G|. Fermat's Little Theorem, and Euler's fancier version of it. In trying to figure out quotients of groups by subgroups, you invented normal subgroups, and quotient groups.
- Sun. Oct. 5: Read 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 by now. 
- Tues. Oct. 7: Quotient sets and quotient groups. Propositions 13 and 14, and Corollary 15. The first and third isomorphism theorems.
- Thurs. Oct. 9: The isomorphism theorems. Composition series and simple groups. Introduction to the alternating group. 
- Sun. Oct. 12: Read 3.4, 3.5, 4.1, and 4.2 by now. 
- Tues. Oct. 14: WIM topic: impossibility of doubling the cube and trisecting a general angle.
- Thurs. Oct. 16: Group actions (kernel, stabilizer, faithful, transitive, orbit). Bijection between the cosets of Stab(a) in G, and the orbit of a. Cayley's Theorem. If p is the smallest prime dividing the order of a group G, then any index p subgroup of G is normal. 

To list Ravi's problem set from Dummit and Foote (there're disgustingly many, the idea is to attempt about 3/5).
