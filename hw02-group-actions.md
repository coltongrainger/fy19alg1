### Generating the dihedral groups [@DF04, number 1.2.7] 

We have $$\langle a,b : a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^n =1\rangle$$ as a presentation for $D_{2n}$ in terms of the two generators^[We assume that every element of $D_{2n}$ which is not a power of $r$ has order $2$, whence one can deduce that $D_{2n}$ is generated by the  two elements $s$ and $sr$ both of which have order $2$. See [@DF04, number 1.2.3].] $a=s$ and $b=sr$ of order $2$.

To verify, denote the above presentation as $D_{ab}$ and define $\phi\colon D_{2n} \to D_{ab}$ by $s\mapsto a$, $r\mapsto ab$, and $r^{-1} \mapsto ba$. We'll show that $\phi$ is an isomorphism of groups. 

To show $\phi$ is a homomorphism, check that the images of the generators $r$ and $s$ satisfy the relations in the canonical presentation of $D_{2n}$:

- $\phi(s)^2 = a^2 = 1$,
- $\phi(r)^n = (ab)^n = 1$, and
- $\phi(r)\phi(s) = (ab)a = a(ba) = \phi(s)\phi(r^{-1})$.

So $\phi$ is a homomorphism. Consider now $\ker(\phi)$. Exhaustively, we list elements in the preimage.

- $s^2 = \phi^{-1}(a^2)$
- $srsr =\phi^{-1}(b^2)$
- $r^n = \phi^{-1}((ab)^n)$

Each element in the domain can be simplified to the identity. So the kernel of $\phi$ is trivial and $\phi$ is an isomorphism. That is, $D_{ab} \cong D_{2n}$. We've shown that $D_{ab}$ gives a presentation of $D_{2n}$ in terms of generating elements of order $2$.

### General linear groups on finite fields [@DF04, number 1.4.5] 

$GL_n(F)$ is a finite group if and only if $F$ has a finite number of elements.

*Proof.* ($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $F$ is finite, say of (prime) order $p$. If $A \in GL_n(F)$, then we'd better have that $\det(A) \neq 0$. We'll enumerate all such possible matrices $A$. 

Consider all distinct $n$-tuples of elements in $F$, concretely, they are the functions $f\colon\{1,\ldots,n\} \to F$. There are $\abs{F}^n = p^n$ such distinct functions. Note only one such function maps each number $j$ to $0 \in F$.

Now, minding that $\det(A) \neq 0$, we can populate the first row of $A$ with $p^n -1$ distinct nonzero $n$-tuples with entries from $F$. The second row cannot be a multiple of the first, so we can populate the second row with only $p^n - p$ distinct nonzero $n$-tuples. The $j$th row has in general $p^n - p^j$ possible arrangements. Hence there are $$\prod_{j=0}^{n-1} (p^n - p^j)$$ distinct matrices in $GL_n(F)$. So $GL_n(F)$ is finite.

($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $F$ is infinite. Then the set of (invertible) diagonal matrices in $GL_n(F)$ is infinite. So $GL_n(F)$ is infinite.\qedsymbol

### The Heisenberg group over a field [@DF04, number 1.4.11]

For a given field $F$ (usually $F=\RR$ for a meaningful interpretation in quantum mechanics), let $H(F)$ be the set of unit upper triangular $3\times 3$ matrices with elements in the upper two diagonals from the field $F$, e.g., $$H(F) = \left\{\begin{pmatrix} 1 & a & b\\ 0 & 1 & c\\ 0 & 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}\text{ such that } a,b,c \in F\right\}.$$ We call this set the *Heisenberg group* over $F$. 

(a) $H(F)$ is closed under matrix multiplication. The set of unit upper triangular matrices (of any finite dimension) is closed under multiplication; specifying, $H(F)$ is closed under matrix multiplication.
(b) $H(F)$ is non-abelian. For example 
    $$\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1& 0\\ & 1& 0\\ & & 1\end{pmatrix} 
    \begin{pmatrix}1 & 0& 1\\ & 1& 1\\ & & 1\end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1& 2\\ & 1& 1\\ & & 1\end{pmatrix} \neq
\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1& 1\\ & 1& 1\\ & & 1\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0& 1\\ & 1& 1\\ & & 1\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1& 0\\ & 1& 0\\ & & 1\end{pmatrix}.$$
(c) $H(F)$ is closed under inverses, with the explicit formula for the matrix inverse of $$\begin{pmatrix}1 & a& b\\ & 1& c\\ & & 1\end{pmatrix} \text{ given by } 
\begin{pmatrix}1 & -a& ac-b\\ & 1& -c\\ & & 1\end{pmatrix}.$$
(d) The associative law holds for $H(F)$. That is, matrix multiplication is associative, and this is a specific case. (Thus $H(F)$ is a group).
(e) Every nonidentity element of the group $H(\RR)$ has infinite order. (Only $0 \in \RR$ has finite additive order.) So if $a$ or $c$ is not $0$, then $$ \begin{pmatrix}1 & a& b\\ & 1& c\\ & & 1\end{pmatrix}^n = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & na& - \\ & 1 & nc\\ & & 1 \end{pmatrix} \neq I \text{ for all } n \in \ZZ.$$

### The order of images under isomorphism [@DF04, number 1.6.2]

\providecommand{\order}[1]{\left\lvert #1\right\rvert}

If $\phi \colon G \to H$ is an isomorphism, then $\order{\phi(x)} = \order{x}$ for all $x \in G$.

*Proof.* Suppose $\phi\colon G \to H$ is an isomorphism. Then for each element $g \in G$ of finite order there's a unique minimal element in the set $\{n \in \NN : g^n = 1\}$. So $\phi(g)^n = \phi(g^n) = \phi(1) = 1$. Hence $\abs{\phi(g)} \leq \abs{g}$.

Since $\phi$ is an isomorphism, its inverse $\phi^{-1}$ exists and is an isomorphism. We recapitulate: For each $\phi(g) \in H$ there's a unique minimal $m \in \NN$ such that $\phi(g)^m = 1$. So $g^m = \phi^{-1}(\phi(g))^m = \phi^{-1}(\phi(g)^m) = \phi^{-1}(1) = 1$. Hence $\abs{g} \leq \abs{\phi(g)}$. 

We conclude that $\abs{g} = \abs{\phi(g)}$, and continue with a corollary. \qedsymbol

Any two isomorphic groups have the same number of elements of order $n$ for each $n \in \NN$. 

*Proof sketch.* $\phi \colon G \to H$ is a bijection. Consider an equivalence relation such that $g E h$ if and only if $\abs{g} = \abs{h}$. Since $\abs{g} = \abs{h}$ if and only if $\abs{\phi(g)} = \abs{\phi(h)}$ we have $g E h$ if and only if $\phi(g) E \phi(h)$. We see that $\phi$ is a bijection that respects membership in the equivalence classes $G/E$ and $H/E$ of elements of order $n$. \qedsymbol

### Isomorphism preserves commutativity [@DF04, number 1.6.3]

If $\phi \colon G \to H$ is an isomorphism, then $G$ is abelian if and only if $H$ is abelian. 

*Proof*. ($\Rightarrow$) Suppose that $G$ is abelian. Then each pair of elements $a,b \in G$ commutes. So $ab = ba$. Hence $\phi(a)\phi(b) = \phi(ab) = \phi(ba) = \phi(b)\phi(a)$. Since $\phi$ is surjective, each pair $c,d \in H$ is the image under $\phi$ of commutative elements. So $H$ is abelian. ($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $H$ is abelian. It's the same argument with the isomorphism $\phi^{-1}$. \qedsymbol

We state as a corollary, if $G$ is abelian and $\phi \colon G \to H$ is a surjective homomorphism, then $H$ is abelian.

### The automorphism group of $G$ [@DF04, number 1.6.20]

\newcommand{\Aut}{\mathrm{Aut}}

Let $G$ be a group and let $\Aut(G)$ be the set of all isomorphisms from $G$ onto $G$ (these isomorphisms are called *automorphisms* of $G$). Then $\Aut(G)$ is a group (called the *automorphism group* of $G$) under function composition.

*Proof*. We'll show $\Aut(G)$ is a group. First note that $\circ \colon \Aut(G) \times \Aut(G) \to \Aut(G)$ is well defined as the composition of two isomorphisms is again an isomorphism. 

(G3) Recall that function composition is associative, so the binary operation $\circ$ is associative. 
(G1) The identity set map $\mathrm{id}_G$ exists and is the identity automorphism.
(G2) If $\phi \in \Aut(G)$ then $\phi$ is a bijective homomorphism from $G$ to $G$, so its functional inverse $\phi^{-1}$ is a bijective homomorphism with again from $G$ to $G$, thus an automorphism. Hence $\phi^{-1} \in \Aut(G)$. One verifies that $\phi^{-1}$ is the left and right inverse of $\phi$ in the group $\Aut(G)$ by composing $\phi^{-1}$ with $\phi$ on the left and right to obtain $\mathrm{id}_G$. \qedsymbol

### An automorphism fixed point free [@DF04, number 1.6.23]

Let $G$ be a finite group which possesses an automorphism $\sigma$ such that $\sigma(g) = g$ if and only if $g=1$. If $\sigma^2$ is the identity map from $G$ to $G$, then $G$ is abelian.^[*Hint*. Every element of $G$ can be written in the form $x^{-1}\sigma(x)$. Apply $\sigma$ to such an expression.]

*Proof sketch.* Suppose $G$ is finite and there's an automorphism $\sigma$ of $G$ such that $\sigma$ fixes $g \in G$ if and only if $g = 1$. Further suppose that $\sigma^2 = \mathrm{id}_G$.

Knowing that $G$ is finite, that $\sigma$ is a bijection, and that each $x^{-1}$ is corresponds uniquely with $x \in G$, apply the pigeon hole principle to write every element of $y \in G$ *uniquely* as $y = x^{-1}\sigma(x)$. Now take $$\sigma(y) = \sigma(x^{-1}\sigma(x)) = \sigma(x^{-1})\sigma^2(x) = \sigma(x)^{-1}\mathrm{id}_G(x).$$

TODO. Show $G$ is abelian.

### Faithful actions of multiplicative groups of fields [@DF04, number 1.7.8] 

Consider a vector space $V$ over a field $F$. We have then the multiplicative group $F^\times = (F\setminus\{0\}, \cdot)$ acting on the set $V$. 

In the special case that $V = \RR^n$ and $F = \RR$, the action is specified by $$\alpha(r_1,\ldots,r_n) = (\alpha r_1, \ldots, \alpha r_n)$$ for all scalars $\alpha \in \RR$ and vectors $(r_1, \ldots, r_n) \in \RR^n$. 

This action is faithful. Why? Suppose that $\beta(\vec{v}) = \vec{v}$ for all $\vec{v} \in \RR^n$, then component-wise $\beta v_i = v_i$ for all $v_i \in \RR$. The field $\RR$ has unique multiplicative identity, so $\beta = 1$ (note that $\beta$ is synonymously the multiplicative identity for the group $\RR^\times$). This is to say, distinct scalars $\alpha, \beta \in \RR^\times$ induce distinct permutations on $\RR^n$.

### Non-example of an action by a non-abelian group [@DF04, number 1.7.14]

Let $G$ be a non-abelian group and let $A = G$. The maps defined by $g\cdot a = ag$ for all $g,a \in G$ do *not* satisfy the axioms of a (left) group action of $G$ on itself.

(GA1) Fails to hold generally in a non-abelian group; consider $(gh)\cdot a = agh \neq ahg = g\cdot (h \cdot a)$ whenever $gh \neq hg$.

### A group action by left multiplication [@DF04, number 1.7.15]

Let $G$ be a group and let $A = G$. The maps defined by $g\cdot a = ag^{-1}$ for all $g,a \in G$ *do* satisfy axioms of a (left) group action of $G$ on itself.

(GA1) We verify $(gh)\cdot a = a(gh)^{-1} = ah^{-1}g^{-1}$ and $g\cdot(h\cdot a) = g \cdot(ah^{-1}) = ah^{-1} g^{-1}$. (GA2) Note $1 \cdot a = a1^{-1} = a1 = a$.

### Orbits under an action [@DF04, number 1.7.18]

Let $H$ be a group acting on a set $A$. The relation $\sim$ on $A$ defined by
$$a \sim b \text{ if and only if } a = hb \text{ for some $h \in H$}$$
is an equivalence relation.^[For each $x \in A$ the equivalence class of $x$ under $\sim$ is called the *orbit* of $x$ under the action of $H$. The orbits under the action of $H$ partition the set $A$.]

*Proof.* We verify reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity for the relation "$a\sim b$ if and only if $a$ and $b$ are in the same orbit under the action of $H$". 

- (Reflexivity) We have $a = 1\cdot a$, so $a\sim a$.
- (Symmetry) We have $a\sim b$ if and only if there's an $h \in H$ such that $a = h\cdot b$. Suppose it is so. Then there's an $h^{-1} \in H$ such that $h^{-1} \cdot a = h^{-1}\cdot (h \cdot b) = (h^{-1}h)\cdot b = b$, implying $b\sim a$.
- (Transitivity) Suppose $a\sim b$ and $b \sim c$. So there are $g,h \in H$ such that $a = hb$ and $b = gc$. $H$ is closed, so $a = hgc$, hence $a\sim c$.

We've shown that the relation "in the same orbit under the action of $H$" is an equivalence relation, and so gives rise to a partition of $A$ into orbits under $H$. \qedsymbol

### Lagrange's theorem [@DF04, number 1.7.19]

Let $H$ be a subgroup of the finite group $G$ and let $H$ act on $G$ by left multiplication. Let $x \in G$ and let $\sO$ be the orbit of $x$ under the action of $H$. Then the map 
$$H \to \sO \text{ defined by } h \mapsto hx$$
is a bijection (hence all orbits have cardinality $\order{H}$). 

*Proof*. The map $H \to \sO$ is surjective (by definition of the equivalence classes) and injective as if $h\cdot x = g\cdot x$, then $$(h^{-1}g)\cdot x = h^{-1} \cdot (g \cdot x) = h^{-1} \cdot (h \cdot x) = (h^{-1}h)\cdot x = 1 \cdot x = x,$$ so $h^{-1}g =1$, hence $g = h$. 

Now we state as a theorem, *if $G$ is a finite group and $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ then $\order{H}$ divides $\order{G}$.*

*Proof.* Having a bijection from a subgroup $H$ to each orbit $\sO$ under the action of $H$, we assert $\abs{H}  = \abs{\sO}$. Now since $G$ (is finite) and is partitioned by finitely many orbits, we must have that $n \abs{H} = n \abs{\sO} = \abs{G}$. This implies that the order of a subgroup $\abs{H}$ divides the order of the group $\abs{G}$. \qedsymbol
