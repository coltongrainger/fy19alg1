### Generating the dihedral groups [@DF04, number 1.2.7] 

We have that $$\langle a,b : a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^n =1\rangle$$ gives a presentation for $D_{2n}$ in terms of the two generators^[We assume that every element of $D_{2n}$ which is not a power of $r$ has order $2$, whence one can deduce that $D_{2n}$ is generated by the  two elements $s$ and $sr$ both of which have order $2$. See [@DF04, number 1.2.3].] $a=s$ and $b=sr$ of order $2$.

### General linear groups on finite fields [@DF04, number 1.4.5] 

$GL_n(F)$ is a finite group if and only if $F$ has a finite number of elements.

### The Heisenberg group over a field [@DF04, number 1.4.11]

For a given field $F$ (usually $F=\RR$ for a meaningful interpretation in quantum mechanics), let $H(F)$ be the set of unit upper triangular $3\times 3$ matrices with elements in the upper two diagonals from the field $F$, e.g., $$H(F) = \left\{\begin{pmatrix} 1 & a & b\\ 0 & 1 & c\\ 0 & 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}\text{ such that } a,b,c \in F\right\}.$$ We call this set the *Heisenberg group* over $F$. 

(a) $H(F)$ is closed under matrix multiplication.
(b) $H(F)$ is non-abelian.
(c) $H(F)$ is closed under inverses (and there's an explicit formula for the matrix inverse).
(d) The associative law holds for $H(F)$. (Thus $H(F)$ is a group).
(e) Every nonidentity element of the group $H(\RR)$ has infinite order.

### The order of images under isomorphism [@DF04, number 1.6.2]

\providecommand{\order}[1]{\left\lvert #1\right\rvert}

If $\phi \colon G \to H$ is an isomorphism, then $\order{\phi(x)} = \order{x}$ for all $x \in G$.

Any two isomorphic groups have the same number of elements of order $n$ for each $n \in \NN$.

### Isomorphism preserves commutativity [@DF04, number 1.6.3]

If $\phi \colon G \to H$ is an isomorphism, then $G$ is abelian if and only if $H$ is abelian.

If $\phi \colon G \to H$ is an homomorphism and $G$ is abelian (and some sufficient conditions hold), then if $H$ is abelian.

### The automorphism group of $G$ [@DF04, number 1.6.20]

\newcommand{\Aut}{\mathrm{Aut}}

Let $G$ be a group and let $\Aut(G)$ be the set of all isomorphisms from $G$ onto $G$ (these isomorphisms are called *automorphisms* of $G$). Then $\Aut(G)$ is a group (called the *automorphism group* of $G$) under function composition.

### An automorphism fixed point free [@DF04, number 1.6.23]

Let $G$ be a finite group which possesses an automorphism $\sigma$ such that $\sigma(g) = g$ if and only if $g=1$. If $\sigma^2$ is the identity map from $G$ to $G$, then $G$ is abelian.^[*Hint*. Every element of $G$ can be written in the form $x^{-1}\sigma(x)$. Apply $\sigma$ to such an expression.]

### Faithful actions of multiplicative groups of fields [@DF04, number 1.7.8] 

Consider a vector space $V$ over a field $F$. We have then the multiplicative group $F^\times = (F\setminus\{0\}, \cdot)$ acting on the set $V$. 

In the space case that $V = \RR^n$ and $F = \RR$, the action is specified by $$\alpha(r_1,\ldots,r_n) = (\alpha r_1, \ldots, \alpha r_n)$$ for all scalars $\alpha \in \RR$ and vectors $(r_1, \ldots, r_n) \in \RR^n$. This action is faithful.

### Non-example of an action by a non-abelian group [@DF04, number 1.7.14]

Let $G$ be a non-abelian group and let $A = G$. The maps defined by $g\cdot a = ga$ for all $g,a \in G$ do *not* satisfy the axioms of a (left) group action of $G$ on itself.

### A group action by left multiplication [@DF04, number 1.7.15]

Let $G$ be a group and let $A = G$. The maps defined by $g\cdot a = ag^{-1}$ for all $g,a \in G$ *do* satisfy axioms of a (left) group action of $G$ on itself.

### Orbits under an action [@DF04, number 1.7.18]

Let $H$ be a group acting on a set $A$. We prove that the relation $\sim$ on $A$ defined by
$$a \sim b \text{ if and only if } a = hb \text{ for some $h \in H$}$$
is an equivalence relation.^[For each $x \in A$ the equivalence class of $x$ under $\sim$ is called the *orbit* of $x$ under the action of $H$. The orbits under the action of $H$ partition the set $A$.]

### Lagrange's theorem [@DF04, number 1.7.19]

Let $H$ be a subgroup of the finite group $G$ and let $H$ act on $G$ by left multiplication. Let $x \in G$ and let $\sO$ be the orbit of $x$ under the action of $H$. Then the map 
$$H \to \sO \text{ defined by } h \mapsto hx$$
is a bijection (hence all orbits have cardinality $\order{H}$). 

If $G$ is a finite group and $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ then $\order{H}$ divides $\order{G}$.
