### [@DF04, number 9.1.4]

\gvn Let $(x)$ and $(x, y)$ be ideals in the ring of polynomials $\QQ[x,y]$.

\wts 

- Both $(x)$ and $(x,y)$ are prime.
- $(x,y)$ is maximal.
- $(x)$ is not maximal.

### [@DF04, number 9.1.10]

**Lemma.** Let $A = (a_i, a_2,..., a_n)$ be a nonzero finitely generated ideal of $R$. There is an ideal $B$ which is maximal with respect to the property that it does not contain $A$.

\gvn Let $R$ be the polynomial ring $\ZZ[x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots]/(x_1x_2, x_3x_4, x_5x_6,\ldots)$.

\wts $R$ contains infinitely many minimal prime ideals.

### [@DF04, number 9.1.13]

\gvn Let $F$ be a field. 

\wts The rings $F[x,y]/(y^2 - x)$ and $F[x,y]/(y^2 - x^2)$ are not isomorphic.

### [@DF04, number 9.2.2]

\renewcommand{\bar}[1]{\overline{ #1 }}

**Lemma.** Let $f(x) \in F[x]$ be a polynomial of degree $n \ge 1$ and let bars denote passage to the quotient $F[x]/(f(x))$. For each $\bar{g(x)}$ there's a unique polynomial $g_0(x)$ of degree strictly less than $n$ such that $\bar{g(x)} = \bar{g_0(x)}$. In other words, the elements $\bar{1}, \bar{x}, \ldots, \bar{x^{n-1}}$ are a basis of the vector space $F[x]/(f(x))$ over $F$. In particular, the dimension of this space is $n$. (Hint: division algorithm.)

\gvn Let $F$ be a finite field of order $q$ and let $f(x)$ be a polynomial in $F[x]$ of degree $n \ge 1$. 

\wts $F[x]/(f(x))$ has $q^n$ elements.

### [@DF04, number 9.2.3]

\gvn Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial in $F[x]$. 

\wts $F[x]/(f(x))$ is a field if and only if $f(x)$ is irreducible. (Hint: every nonzero prime ideal in a PID is maximal.)

### [@DF04, number 9.2.4]

\gvn Let $F$ be a finite field. 

\wts $F[x]$ contains infinitely many primes. (Note that over an infinite field the polynomials of degree $1$ are an infinite set of primes in the ring of polynomials.)

### [@DF04, number 9.2.10]

*To find.* The greatest common divisor of $a(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 + x - 6$ and $b(x) = x^5 - 6x + 5$ in $\QQ[x]$, expressed as a $\QQ[x]$-linear combination of $a(x)$ and $b(x)$.

### [@DF04, number 9.3.3]

\gvn Let $F$ be a field. 

\wts The set $R$ of polynomials in $F[x]$ whose coefficient of $X$ is equal to $0$ is a subring of $F[x]$ and $R$ is not a UFD. (Hint: show that $x^6 = (x^2)^3 = (x^3)^2$ gives two distinct factorization of $x^6$ into irreducibles.)

### [@DF04, number 9.4.7]

\gvn The ring of polynomials $\RR[x]$ and the ideal generated by $x^2+1$.

\wts $\RR[x]/(x^2 + 1)$ is a field that's isomorphic to the complex numbers.

### [@DF04, number 9.4.12]

\gvn The ring of polynomials $\ZZ[x]$ and the polynomial $x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} + \cdots + x + 1$. 

\wts $x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} + \cdots + x + 1$ is irreducible in $\ZZ[x]$ if and only if $n$ is a prime.

### [@DF04, number 9.4.16]

\gvn Let $F$ be a field and let $f(x)$ be a polynomial of degree $n$ in $F[x]$. The polynomial $g(x) = x^n f(1/x)$ is called the reverse of $f(x)$.

*To demonstrate.*

(a) Describe the coefficients of $g$ in terms of the coefficients of $f$.
(b) $f$ is irreducible if and only if $g$ is irreducible.

### A variant of Eisenstein's Criterion [@DF04, number 9.4.17]

\gvn et $P$ be a prime ideal in the Unique Factorization Domain $R$ and let $f(x) = a_n x^n  + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0$ be a polynomial in $R[x]$, $n \ge 1$. Suppose $a_n \notin P$, $a_{n-1}, \ldots, a_0 \in P$ and $a_0 \notin P^2$. 

\wts $f(x)$ is irreducible in $F[x]$, where $F$ is the quotient field of $R$.
