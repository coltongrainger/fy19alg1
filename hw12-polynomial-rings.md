### [@DF04, number 9.1.4]

\gvn Let $(x)$ and $(x, y)$ be ideals in the ring of polynomials $\QQ[x,y]$.

\wts 

i. $(x)$ is prime and not maximal.
ii. $(x,y)$ is prime and maximal.

\pf We can obtain an isomorphic copy of any ring $R$ from its polynomial ring $R[x]$ either

- by taking the image of $R[x]$ under the evaluate at $0$ ring homomorphism, or
- by quotienting out the ideal generated by the indeterminate $(x)$.

That $R \cong \mathrm{ev}_0\left(R[x]\right)$ is apparent; we'll justify  $R \cong R[x] / (x)$. Consider the homomorphism $\pi \circ \iota \colon R \to R[x] / (x)$, as in the following commutative diagram.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={fill=white}]
\draw[right hook->] (-2,2) -- (1.3,2);
\draw[->] (-2,2) -- (1.2,0.2);
\draw[->] (2,2) -- (2,0.5);

\node at (-2,2) {$R$};
\node at (0,2.3) {$\iota$};
\node at (2,2) {$R[x]$};
\node at (2,0) {$R[x]/(x)$};
\node at (2.5,1) {$\pi$};
\node at (-0.5,0.7) {$\pi\circ\iota$};

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

For all nonzero $a \in R$, in $R[x]$ the ideal $(x)$ does not contain $a$. Whence $\ker (\pi \circ \iota) = 0$. Similarly, for each $r + (x) \in R[x]/(x)$, there's $r \in R$ such that $\pi(\iota(r)) = r + (x)$. So $\pi \circ \iota$ is ring isomorphism.

In particular, consider the field $\QQ$ and the UFD $\QQ[y]$:

i. $\QQ[x,y]/(x) \cong \QQ[y]$ is an entire ring, but not a field. Thus $(x)$ is prime, but not maximal [@DF04, section 7.4].
ii. $\QQ[x,y]/(x,y) \cong (\QQ[x][y]/(y))/(x) \cong \QQ[x]/(x) \cong \QQ$ is a field. Thus $(x,y)$ is maximal (so prime too). The isomorphism $\QQ[x,y]/(x,y) \cong (\QQ[x][y]/(y))/(x)$ follows from $(x,y) = (x) + (y)$. \qedsymbol

\renewcommand{\bar}[1]{\overline{ #1 }}

\gvn Let $R$ be the  polynomial ring $\ZZ[x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots]$, a UFD [@DF04, section 9.3]. Let $\bar{R}$ be the quotient ring $\ZZ[x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots]/(x_1x_2, x_3x_4, x_5x_6,\ldots)$.

\wts $\bar R$ contains infinitely many minimal prime ideals. We define a minimal prime ideal as "an ideal $\fp$ in a commutative unital ring $R$ that's *prime* and does not strictly contain another prime ideal."^[<https://commalg.subwiki.org/wiki/Minimal_prime_ideal>]

\pf We inject the set $2^\NN$ of infinite coin flips into the set of minimal prime ideals in $\bar{R}$ via the function
$$\text{the sequence } (e_1, e_2, e_3, \ldots)  \mapsto  \text{ the ideal } (x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots).$$

It's routine to verify this function is an injection. We now focus to argue each ideal in the image is a minimal prime ideal. 

- Observe $(x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots) \supset (x_1x_2, x_3x_4, x_5x_6,\ldots).$ 
    So $$\bar{R} / (x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots) \cong R / (x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots).$$
    For each "coin flip", need indices to access "the complementary event". 
    So define $\bar{e_n} = 0$ if $e_n = 1$, else $\bar{e_n} = 1$. 
    By quotienting, we're just killing off the indeterminates whose indices are "hit" by our particular sequence of coin flips. 
    So $$R / (x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots) \cong \ZZ[x_{1+\bar{e_1}}, x_{3+\bar{e_2}}, x_{5+\bar{e_3}}].$$ 
    Relabelling indices, $$\ZZ[x_{1+\bar{e_1}}, x_{3+\bar{e_2}}, x_{5+\bar{e_3}}] \cong R.$$
    Stringing these isomorphisms together, we conclude that the ideal $(x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots)$ is *prime* in $\bar{R}$ because the quotient $\bar{R} / (x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots) \cong R$ is entire.

- Now consider any proper ideal $\fa \subsetneq (x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots)$. 
    We can think of $\fa$ as a sequence of coin flips that forgets at least one outcome. 
    So verify that $$\fa \not\supset (x_1x_2, x_3x_4, x_5x_6,\ldots).$$ 
    In particular, there's some odd positive $i$ for which the product $x_i x_{i+1} \notin \fa$ (one of the events forgotten!). 
    Quotienting $\fa$ out of $\bar{R}$, the ring $\bar{R} / \fa$ has $\bar{ x_i }$ and $\bar{ x_{i+1} }$ as zero divisors (boo!). 
    Therefore $\fa$ is not prime. 
    We conclude $(x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots)$ is a *minimal* prime ideal. \qedsymbol

### [@DF04, number 9.1.13]

\gvn Let $F$ be a field. 

\wts The rings $F[x,y]/(y^2 - x)$ and $F[x,y]/(y^2 - x^2)$ are not isomorphic.

\pf As $F$ is a field, $F[y]$ is a Euclidean domain, hence $F[x,y]$ is a UFD. So the irreducible polynomials in $F[x,y]$ are exactly the prime polynomials. Now 

- $y^2 - x^2 = (y-x)(y+x)$ is not prime, thus $F[x,y]/(y^2 - x^2)$ has zero divisors;
- $y^2 - x$ is irreducible,^[Consider $-x + y^2$ as a polynomial in $x$ with coefficients in $F[y]$. It's linear. Into what non-constant polynomials could it factor?] so prime, thus $F[x,y]/(y^2 - x)$ is an entire ring. 

Since the property of being an entire ring is invariant under ring isomorphism, the two quotients cannot be isomorphic. \qedsymbol

### [@DF04, number 9.2.2]

**Lemma.** Let $f(x) \in F[x]$ be a polynomial of degree $n \ge 1$ and let bars denote passage to the quotient $F[x]/(f(x))$. For each $\bar{g(x)}$ there's a unique polynomial $g_0(x)$ of degree strictly less than $n$ such that $\bar{g(x)} = \bar{g_0(x)}$. 

Commentary "In other words, the elements $\bar{1}, \bar{x}, \ldots, \bar{x^{n-1}}$ are a basis of the vector space $F[x]/(f(x))$ over $F$."

\gvn Let $F$ be a finite field of order $q$ and let $f(x)$ be a polynomial in $F[x]$ of degree $n \ge 1$. 

\wts $F[x]/(f(x))$ has $q^n$ elements.

### [@DF04, number 9.2.3]

\gvn Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial in $F[x]$. 

\wts $F[x]/(f(x))$ is a field if and only if $f(x)$ is irreducible. (Hint: every nonzero prime ideal in a PID is maximal.)

### [@DF04, number 9.2.4]

\gvn Let $F$ be a finite field. 

\wts $F[x]$ contains infinitely many primes. (Note that over an infinite field the polynomials of degree $1$ are an infinite set of primes in the ring of polynomials.)

### [@DF04, number 9.2.10]

*To find.* The greatest common divisor of $a(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 + x - 6$ and $b(x) = x^5 - 6x + 5$ in $\QQ[x]$, expressed as a $\QQ[x]$-linear combination of $a(x)$ and $b(x)$.

### [@DF04, number 9.3.3]

\gvn Let $F$ be a field. 

\wts The set $R$ of polynomials in $F[x]$ whose coefficient of $X$ is equal to $0$ is a subring of $F[x]$ and $R$ is not a UFD. (Hint: show that $x^6 = (x^2)^3 = (x^3)^2$ gives two distinct factorization of $x^6$ into irreducibles.)

### [@DF04, number 9.4.7]

\gvn The ring of polynomials $\RR[x]$ and the ideal generated by $x^2+1$.

\wts $\RR[x]/(x^2 + 1)$ is a field that's isomorphic to the complex numbers.

### [@DF04, number 9.4.12]

\gvn The ring of polynomials $\ZZ[x]$ and the polynomial $x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} + \cdots + x + 1$. 

\wts $x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} + \cdots + x + 1$ is irreducible in $\ZZ[x]$ if and only if $n$ is a prime.

### [@DF04, number 9.4.16]

\gvn Let $F$ be a field and let $f(x)$ be a polynomial of degree $n$ in $F[x]$. The polynomial $g(x) = x^n f(1/x)$ is called the reverse of $f(x)$.

*To demonstrate.*

(a) Describe the coefficients of $g$ in terms of the coefficients of $f$.
(b) $f$ is irreducible if and only if $g$ is irreducible.

### A variant of Eisenstein's Criterion [@DF04, number 9.4.17]

\gvn et $P$ be a prime ideal in the Unique Factorization Domain $R$ and let $f(x) = a_n x^n  + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0$ be a polynomial in $R[x]$, $n \ge 1$. Suppose $a_n \notin P$, $a_{n-1}, \ldots, a_0 \in P$ and $a_0 \notin P^2$. 

\wts $f(x)$ is irreducible in $F[x]$, where $F$ is the quotient field of $R$.
