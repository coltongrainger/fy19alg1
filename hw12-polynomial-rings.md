### [@DF04, number 9.1.4]

\gvn Let $(x)$ and $(x, y)$ be ideals in the ring of polynomials $\QQ[x,y]$.

\wts 

i. $(x)$ is prime and not maximal.
ii. $(x,y)$ is prime and maximal.

\pf We can obtain an isomorphic copy of any ring $R$ from its polynomial ring $R[x]$ either

- by taking the image of $R[x]$ under the evaluate at $0$ ring homomorphism, or
- by quotienting out the ideal generated by the indeterminate $(x)$.

That $R \cong \mathrm{ev}_0\left(R[x]\right)$ is apparent; we'll justify  $R \cong R[x] / (x)$. Consider the homomorphism $\pi \circ \iota \colon R \to R[x] / (x)$, as in the following commutative diagram.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={fill=white}]
\draw[right hook->] (-2,2) -- (1.3,2);
\draw[->] (-2,2) -- (1.2,0.2);
\draw[->] (2,2) -- (2,0.5);

\node at (-2,2) {$R$};
\node at (0,2.3) {$\iota$};
\node at (2,2) {$R[x]$};
\node at (2,0) {$R[x]/(x)$};
\node at (2.5,1) {$\pi$};
\node at (-0.5,0.7) {$\pi\circ\iota$};

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

For all nonzero $a \in R$, in $R[x]$ the ideal $(x)$ does not contain $a$. Whence $\ker (\pi \circ \iota) = 0$. Similarly, for each $r + (x) \in R[x]/(x)$, there's $r \in R$ such that $\pi(\iota(r)) = r + (x)$. So $\pi \circ \iota$ is ring isomorphism.

In particular, consider the field $\QQ$ and the UFD $\QQ[y]$:

i. $\QQ[x,y]/(x) \cong \QQ[y]$ is an entire ring, but not a field. Thus $(x)$ is prime, but not maximal [@DF04, section 7.4].
ii. $\QQ[x,y]/(x,y) \cong (\QQ[x][y]/(y))/(x) \cong \QQ[x]/(x) \cong \QQ$ is a field. Thus $(x,y)$ is maximal (so prime too). The isomorphism $\QQ[x,y]/(x,y) \cong (\QQ[x][y]/(y))/(x)$ follows from $(x,y) = (x) + (y)$. \qedsymbol

\renewcommand{\bar}[1]{\overline{ #1 }}

\gvn Let $R$ be the  polynomial ring $\ZZ[x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots]$, a UFD [@DF04, section 9.3]. Let $\bar{R}$ be the quotient ring $\ZZ[x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots]/(x_1x_2, x_3x_4, x_5x_6,\ldots)$.

\wts $\bar R$ contains infinitely many minimal prime ideals. We define a minimal prime ideal as "an ideal $\fp$ in a commutative unital ring $R$ that's *prime* and does not strictly contain another prime ideal."^[<https://commalg.subwiki.org/wiki/Minimal_prime_ideal>]

\pf We inject the set $2^\NN$ of infinite coin flips into the set of minimal prime ideals in $\bar{R}$ via the function
$$\text{the sequence } (e_1, e_2, e_3, \ldots)  \mapsto  \text{ the ideal } (x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots).$$

It's routine to verify this function is an injection. We now focus to argue each ideal in the image is a minimal prime ideal. 

- Observe $(x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots) \supset (x_1x_2, x_3x_4, x_5x_6,\ldots).$ 
    So $$\bar{R} / (x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots) \cong R / (x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots).$$
    For each "coin flip", need indices to access "the complementary event". 
    So define $\bar{e_n} = 0$ if $e_n = 1$, else $\bar{e_n} = 1$. 
    By quotienting, we're just killing off the indeterminates whose indices are "hit" by our particular sequence of coin flips. 
    So $$R / (x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots) \cong \ZZ[x_{1+\bar{e_1}}, x_{3+\bar{e_2}}, x_{5+\bar{e_3}}].$$ 
    Relabelling indices, $$\ZZ[x_{1+\bar{e_1}}, x_{3+\bar{e_2}}, x_{5+\bar{e_3}}] \cong R.$$
    Stringing these isomorphisms together, we conclude that the ideal $(x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots)$ is *prime* in $\bar{R}$ because the quotient $\bar{R} / (x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots) \cong R$ is entire.

- Now consider any proper ideal $\fa \subsetneq (x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots)$. 
    We can think of $\fa$ as a sequence of coin flips that forgets at least one outcome. 
    So verify that $$\fa \not\supset (x_1x_2, x_3x_4, x_5x_6,\ldots).$$ 
    In particular, there's some odd positive $i$ for which the product $x_i x_{i+1} \notin \fa$ (one of the events forgotten!). 
    Quotienting $\fa$ out of $\bar{R}$, the ring $\bar{R} / \fa$ has $\bar{ x_i }$ and $\bar{ x_{i+1} }$ as zero divisors. 
    Therefore $\fa$ is not prime. 
    We conclude $(x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots)$ is a *minimal* prime ideal. \qedsymbol

### [@DF04, number 9.1.13]

\gvn Let $F$ be a field. 

\wts The rings $F[x,y]/(y^2 - x)$ and $F[x,y]/(y^2 - x^2)$ are not isomorphic.

\pf As $F$ is a field, $F[y]$ is a Euclidean domain, hence $F[x,y]$ is a UFD. So the irreducible polynomials in $F[x,y]$ are exactly the prime polynomials. Now 

- $y^2 - x^2 = (y-x)(y+x)$ is not prime, thus $F[x,y]/(y^2 - x^2)$ has zero divisors;
- $y^2 - x$ is irreducible,^[Consider $-x + y^2$ as a polynomial in $x$ with coefficients in $F[y]$. It's linear. Into what non-constant polynomials could it factor?] so prime, thus $F[x,y]/(y^2 - x)$ is an entire ring. 

Since the property of being an entire ring is invariant under ring isomorphism, the two quotients cannot be isomorphic. \qedsymbol

**Lemma.** Suppose $F$ is a field. Let $f(x) \in F[x]$ be a polynomial of degree $n \ge 1$ and let bars denote passage to the quotient $F[x]/(f(x))$. For each $\bar{g(x)}$ there's a unique polynomial $r(x)$ of degree strictly less than $n$ such that $\bar{g(x)} = \bar{r(x)}$. 

*Proof.* Let $f(x) \in F[x]$ as above, a nonconstant polynomial. 
Let $\bar{g(x)} \in F[x] / (f(x))$. 
There exists $g(x) \in F[x]$ which projects to $\bar{g(x)}$.
Now $F[x]$ is a Euclidean domain (with a division algorithm that produces *unique* remainders), so divide $g(x)$ by $f(x)$ to obtain unique $a(x), r(x) \in F[x]$ such that 
$$g(x) = a(x)f(x) + r(x) \quad \text{ where } \quad 0 \le \deg r < \deg f.$$
The difference $g(x) - r(x) \in (f(x))$, so in the quotient $\bar{g(x)} = \bar{r(x)}$. \qedsymbol

Knowing the lemma holds, we know each for polynomial $\bar{g(x)} \in F[x]/(f(x))$, there's a unique $r(x) \in F[x]$ such that $\bar{g(x)} = \bar{r(x)}$, where $\bar{r(x)}$ is in the span of the elements $\bar{1}, \bar{x}, \ldots, \bar{x^{n-1}}$. To see this span is minimal, consider that its vectors are pairwise orthogonal.

### [@DF04, number 9.2.2]

\gvn Let $F$ be a finite field of order $q$ and let $f(x)$ be a polynomial in $F[x]$ of degree $n \ge 1$. 

\wts $F[x]/(f(x))$ has $q^n$ elements.

\pf We enumerate each distinct vector $\bar{r(x)}$ (of degree strictly less than $n$ as above) in $F[x]/(f(x))$ by the coefficient of its $k$th degree term for $k=0, \ldots, n-1$. But each coefficient is in the finite field $\FF_q$, so the number of distinct coefficients for $\bar{r(x)}$ is $q^n$. By lemma, $\bar{1}, \bar{x}, \ldots, \bar{x^{n-1}}$ is a basis. By considering the distinct coefficients of $\bar{r(x)}$, we've taken exactly all distinct linear combinations of basis vectors. Since each of $n$ basis vectors can be scaled with one of $q$ scalars in the finite field $\FF_q$, we conclude $\abs{F[x]/(f(x))} = q^n$. \qedsymbol

### [@DF04, number 9.2.3]

\gvn Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial in $F[x]$. 

\wts $F[x]/(f(x))$ is a field if and only if $f(x)$ is irreducible. 

\newcommand{\fore}{($\Rightarrow$)\ }
\newcommand{\back}{($\Leftarrow$)\ }

\pf We apply the hierarchy theorem in full force to exploit that $F[x]$ is a Euclidean domain. \fore Suppose that $F[x]/(f(x))$ is a field. Then $(f(x))$ is a maximal ideal. As $F[x]$ is an entire ring, $(f(x))$ is prime. Because $F[x]$ is a UFD, $f(x)$ is irreducible. \back Suppose $f(x)$ is irreducible. Then as $F[x]$ is a Euclidean domain, $f(x)$ is prime. Now $(f(x))$ is a prime ideal in a PID, so $(f(x))$ is maximal. Therefore $F[x]/(f(x))$ is a field. \qedsymbol

### [@DF04, number 9.2.4]

\gvn Let $F$ be a finite field. 

\wts $F[x]$ contains infinitely many primes.

*Proof by contradiction.* Suppose $\{p_1(x), \ldots, p_n(x)\}$ is the finite set of all prime polynomials in $F[x]$. Consider the nonconstant polynomial $$f(x) =  \prod_1^n p_i(x) + 1$$ in $F[x]$. Since none of prime ideals $(p_i(x))$ contain $1$, neither do they contain $f(x)$. But $F[x]$ is a Euclidean domain, so a UFD, and we must have a representation of $$f(x) = \prod_1^m q_j(x)$$ as a product of irreducible, thus prime, polynomials $q_j(x)$. By construction of $f(x)$, $$\{q_1(x), \ldots, q_m(x)\} \text{ and } \{p_1(x), \ldots, p_n(x)\} \text{ are disjoint.}$$
Absurd!---$\{p_1(x), \ldots, p_n(x)\}$ is supposed to be the exhaustive set of primes! \qedsymbol

### [@DF04, number 9.2.10 set of primes]

*To find.* The greatest common divisor of $m(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 + x - 6$ and $n(x) = x^5 - 6x + 5$ in $\QQ[x]$, expressed as a $\QQ[x]$-linear combination of $m(x)$ and $n(x)$.

*Demonstration*. A GCD of $n(x)$ and $m(x)$ is $x-1$. It's the last nonzero remainder in the extended Euclidean algorithm. To wit:

```python
>>> R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ, sparse=True)
>>> (x^5 - 6*x + 5).quo_rem(x^3 + 4*x^2 + x - 6)

(x^2 - 4*x + 15, -50*x^2 - 45*x + 95)

>>> (x^3 + 4*x^2 + x - 6).quo_rem(-50*x^2 - 45*x + 95)

(-1/50*x - 31/500, 11/100*x - 11/100)

>>> (-50*x^2 - 45*x + 95).quo_rem(11/100*x - 11/100)

(-5000/11*x - 9500/11, 0)
```

We also want Bézout coefficients, to see that $x - 1$ is a linear combination of $n(x)$ and $m(x)$. Here's an imperative implementation^[See <https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/polynomial_rings/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element_generic.html>, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_greatest_common_divisor>.] of the extended Euclidean algorithm that records the desired coefficients.

```python
>>> def extgcd(n,m):
>>> 
>>>     """a wrapper around SAGE to compute a GCD and Bézout coefficients"""
>>> 
>>>     # initialize remainder and Bézout coeff arrays
>>>     r = []; s = [1,0]; t = [0,1]
>>> 
>>>     # we assume deg(n) >= deg(m)
>>>     r.append(n)
>>>     r.append(m)
>>> 
>>>     # while the last remainder is nonzero
>>>     while r[-1] != 0:
>>> 
>>>         # long divide
>>>         (quo,rem) = r[-2].quo_rem(r[-1])
>>> 
>>>         # append remainder and latest Bézout coeffs
>>>         r.append(rem)
>>>         s.append(s[-2] - quo*s[-1])
>>>         t.append(t[-2] - quo*t[-1])
>>>     
>>>     # second to last remainder and coeffs
>>>     return r[-2], s[-2], t[-2]
```

Why is this procedure meaningful?

```python
>>> n = x^5 - 6*x + 5
>>> m = x^3 + 4*x^2 + x - 6
>>> (gcd, s, t) = extgcd(n,m)
>>> print(gcd, s, t)

(11/100*x - 11/100, 1/50*x + 31/500, -1/50*x^3 + 9/500*x^2 - 13/250*x + 7/100)

>>> n*s + m*t == gcd

True
```
