### [@DF04, number 9.1.4]

\gvn Let $(x)$ and $(x, y)$ be ideals in the ring of polynomials $\QQ[x,y]$.

\wts 

i. $(x)$ is prime and not maximal.
ii. $(x,y)$ is prime and maximal.

\pf We can obtain an isomorphic copy of any ring $R$ from its polynomial ring $R[x]$ either

- by taking the image of $R[x]$ under the evaluate at $0$ ring homomorphism, or
- by quotienting out the ideal generated by the indeterminate $(x)$.

That $R \cong \mathrm{ev}_0\left(R[x]\right)$ is apparent; we'll justify  $R \cong R[x] / (x)$. Consider the homomorphism $\pi \circ \iota \colon R \to R[x] / (x)$, as in the following commutative diagram.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={fill=white}]
\draw[right hook->] (-2,2) -- (1.3,2);
\draw[->] (-2,2) -- (1.2,0.2);
\draw[->] (2,2) -- (2,0.5);

\node at (-2,2) {$R$};
\node at (0,2.3) {$\iota$};
\node at (2,2) {$R[x]$};
\node at (2,0) {$R[x]/(x)$};
\node at (2.5,1) {$\pi$};
\node at (-0.5,0.7) {$\pi\circ\iota$};

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

For all nonzero $a \in R$, in $R[x]$ the ideal $(x)$ does not contain $a$. Whence $\ker (\pi \circ \iota) = 0$. Similarly, for each $r + (x) \in R[x]/(x)$, there's $r \in R$ such that $\pi(\iota(r)) = r + (x)$. So $\pi \circ \iota$ is ring isomorphism.

In particular, consider the field $\QQ$ and the UFD $\QQ[y]$:

i. $\QQ[x,y]/(x) \cong \QQ[y]$ is an entire ring, but not a field. Thus $(x)$ is prime, but not maximal [@DF04, section 7.4].
ii. $\QQ[x,y]/(x,y) \cong (\QQ[x][y]/(y))/(x) \cong \QQ[x]/(x) \cong \QQ$ is a field. Thus $(x,y)$ is maximal (so prime too). The isomorphism $\QQ[x,y]/(x,y) \cong (\QQ[x][y]/(y))/(x)$ follows from $(x,y) = (x) + (y)$. \qedsymbol

\renewcommand{\bar}[1]{\overline{ #1 }}

\gvn Let $R$ be the  polynomial ring $\ZZ[x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots]$, a UFD [@DF04, section 9.3]. Let $\bar{R}$ be the quotient ring $\ZZ[x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots]/(x_1x_2, x_3x_4, x_5x_6,\ldots)$.

\wts $\bar R$ contains infinitely many minimal prime ideals. We define a minimal prime ideal as "an ideal $\fp$ in a commutative unital ring $R$ that's *prime* and does not strictly contain another prime ideal."^[<https://commalg.subwiki.org/wiki/Minimal_prime_ideal>]

\pf We inject the set $2^\NN$ of infinite coin flips into the set of minimal prime ideals in $\bar{R}$ via the function
$$\text{the sequence } (e_1, e_2, e_3, \ldots)  \mapsto  \text{ the ideal } (x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots).$$

It's routine to verify this function is an injection. We now focus to argue each ideal in the image is a minimal prime ideal. 

- Observe $(x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots) \supset (x_1x_2, x_3x_4, x_5x_6,\ldots).$ 
    So $$\bar{R} / (x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots) \cong R / (x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots).$$
    For each "coin flip", need indices to access "the complementary event". 
    So define $\bar{e_n} = 0$ if $e_n = 1$, else $\bar{e_n} = 1$. 
    By quotienting, we're just killing off the indeterminates whose indices are "hit" by our particular sequence of coin flips. 
    So $$R / (x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots) \cong \ZZ[x_{1+\bar{e_1}}, x_{3+\bar{e_2}}, x_{5+\bar{e_3}}].$$ 
    Relabelling indices, $$\ZZ[x_{1+\bar{e_1}}, x_{3+\bar{e_2}}, x_{5+\bar{e_3}}] \cong R.$$
    Stringing these isomorphisms together, we conclude that the ideal $(x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots)$ is *prime* in $\bar{R}$ because the quotient $\bar{R} / (x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots) \cong R$ is entire.

- Now consider any proper ideal $\fa \subsetneq (x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots)$. 
    We can think of $\fa$ as a sequence of coin flips that forgets at least one outcome. 
    So verify that $$\fa \not\supset (x_1x_2, x_3x_4, x_5x_6,\ldots).$$ 
    In particular, there's some odd positive $i$ for which the product $x_i x_{i+1} \notin \fa$ (one of the events forgotten!). 
    Quotienting $\fa$ out of $\bar{R}$, the ring $\bar{R} / \fa$ has $\bar{ x_i }$ and $\bar{ x_{i+1} }$ as zero divisors. 
    Therefore $\fa$ is not prime. 
    We conclude $(x_{1+e_1}, x_{3+e_2}, x_{5+e_3}, \ldots)$ is a *minimal* prime ideal. \qedsymbol

### [@DF04, number 9.1.13]

\gvn Let $F$ be a field. 

\wts The rings $F[x,y]/(y^2 - x)$ and $F[x,y]/(y^2 - x^2)$ are not isomorphic.

\pf As $F$ is a field, $F[y]$ is a Euclidean domain, hence $F[x,y]$ is a UFD. So the irreducible polynomials in $F[x,y]$ are exactly the prime polynomials. Now 

- $y^2 - x^2 = (y-x)(y+x)$ is not prime, thus $F[x,y]/(y^2 - x^2)$ has zero divisors;
- $y^2 - x$ is irreducible,^[Consider $-x + y^2$ as a polynomial in $x$ with coefficients in $F[y]$. It's linear. Into what non-constant polynomials could it factor?] so prime, thus $F[x,y]/(y^2 - x)$ is an entire ring. 

Since the property of being an entire ring is invariant under ring isomorphism, the two quotients cannot be isomorphic. \qedsymbol

**Lemma.** Suppose $F$ is a field. Let $f(x) \in F[x]$ be a polynomial of degree $n \ge 1$ and let bars denote passage to the quotient $F[x]/(f(x))$. For each $\bar{g(x)}$ there's a unique polynomial $r(x)$ of degree strictly less than $n$ such that $\bar{g(x)} = \bar{r(x)}$. 

*Proof.* Let $f(x) \in F[x]$ as above, a nonconstant polynomial. 
Let $\bar{g(x)} \in F[x] / (f(x))$. 
There exists $g(x) \in F[x]$ which projects to $\bar{g(x)}$.
Now $F[x]$ is a Euclidean domain (with a division algorithm that produces *unique* remainders), so divide $g(x)$ by $f(x)$ to obtain unique $a(x), r(x) \in F[x]$ such that 
$$g(x) = a(x)f(x) + r(x) \quad \text{ where } \quad 0 \le \deg r < \deg f.$$
The difference $g(x) - r(x) \in (f(x))$, so in the quotient $\bar{g(x)} = \bar{r(x)}$. \qedsymbol

Knowing the lemma holds, we know each for polynomial $\bar{g(x)} \in F[x]/(f(x))$, there's a unique $r(x) \in F[x]$ such that $\bar{g(x)} = \bar{r(x)}$, where $\bar{r(x)}$ is in the span of the elements $\bar{1}, \bar{x}, \ldots, \bar{x^{n-1}}$. To see this span is minimal, consider that its vectors are pairwise orthogonal.

### [@DF04, number 9.2.2]

\gvn Let $F$ be a finite field of order $q$ and let $f(x)$ be a polynomial in $F[x]$ of degree $n \ge 1$. 

\wts $F[x]/(f(x))$ has $q^n$ elements.

\pf We enumerate each distinct vector $\bar{r(x)}$ (of degree strictly less than $n$ as above) in $F[x]/(f(x))$ by the coefficient of its $k$th degree term for $k=0, \ldots, n-1$. But each coefficient is in the finite field $\FF_q$, so the number of distinct coefficients for $\bar{r(x)}$ is $q^n$. By lemma, $\bar{1}, \bar{x}, \ldots, \bar{x^{n-1}}$ is a basis. By considering the distinct coefficients of $\bar{r(x)}$, we've taken exactly all distinct linear combinations of basis vectors. Since each of $n$ basis vectors can be scaled with one of $q$ scalars in the finite field $\FF_q$, we conclude $\abs{F[x]/(f(x))} = q^n$. \qedsymbol

### [@DF04, number 9.2.3]

\gvn Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial in $F[x]$. 

\wts $F[x]/(f(x))$ is a field if and only if $f(x)$ is irreducible. 

\newcommand{\fore}{($\Rightarrow$)\ }
\newcommand{\back}{($\Leftarrow$)\ }

\pf We apply the hierarchy theorem in full force to exploit that $F[x]$ is a Euclidean domain. \fore Suppose that $F[x]/(f(x))$ is a field. Then $(f(x))$ is a maximal ideal. As $F[x]$ is an entire ring, $(f(x))$ is prime. Because $F[x]$ is a UFD, $f(x)$ is irreducible. \back Suppose $f(x)$ is irreducible. Then as $F[x]$ is a Euclidean domain, $f(x)$ is prime. Now $(f(x))$ is a prime ideal in a PID, so $(f(x))$ is maximal. Therefore $F[x]/(f(x))$ is a field. \qedsymbol

### [@DF04, number 9.2.4]

\gvn Let $F$ be a finite field. 

\wts $F[x]$ contains infinitely many primes.

*Proof by contradiction.* Suppose $\{p_1(x), \ldots, p_n(x)\}$ is the finite set of all prime polynomials in $F[x]$. Consider the nonconstant polynomial $$f(x) =  \prod_1^n p_i(x) + 1$$ in $F[x]$. Since none of prime ideals $(p_i(x))$ contain $1$, neither do they contain $f(x)$. But $F[x]$ is a Euclidean domain, so a UFD, and we must have a representation of $$f(x) = \prod_1^m q_j(x)$$ as a product of irreducible, thus prime, polynomials $q_j(x)$. By construction of $f(x)$, $$\{q_1(x), \ldots, q_m(x)\} \text{ and } \{p_1(x), \ldots, p_n(x)\} \text{ are disjoint.}$$
Absurd!---$\{p_1(x), \ldots, p_n(x)\}$ is supposed to be the exhaustive set of primes! \qedsymbol

### [@DF04, number 9.2.10 set of primes]

*To find.* The greatest common divisor of $m(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 + x - 6$ and $n(x) = x^5 - 6x + 5$ in $\QQ[x]$, expressed as a $\QQ[x]$-linear combination of $m(x)$ and $n(x)$.

*Demonstration*. A GCD of $n(x)$ and $m(x)$ is $x-1$. It's the last nonzero remainder in the extended Euclidean algorithm. In gruesome hard-coded detail (*feel free to skim to the next page*).

```python
>>> R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ, sparse=True)
>>> # n.quo_rem(m) long divides n by m and returns (quotient, remainder) 
>>> (x^5 - 6*x + 5).quo_rem(x^3 + 4*x^2 + x - 6)
(x^2 - 4*x + 15, -50*x^2 - 45*x + 95)
>>> (x^3 + 4*x^2 + x - 6).quo_rem(-50*x^2 - 45*x + 95)
(-1/50*x - 31/500, 11/100*x - 11/100)
>>> (-50*x^2 - 45*x + 95).quo_rem(11/100*x - 11/100)
(-5000/11*x - 9500/11, 0)
```

We also want Bézout coefficients, to see that $x - 1$ is a linear combination of $n(x)$ and $m(x)$. Here's an imperative implementation^[See <https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/polynomial_rings/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element_generic.html>, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_greatest_common_divisor>.] of the extended Euclidean algorithm that records the desired coefficients.

```python
>>> def extgcd(n,m):
>>> 
>>>     """a wrapper around SAGE to compute a GCD and Bézout coefficients"""
>>> 
>>>     # initialize remainder and Bézout coeff arrays
>>>     r = []; s = [1,0]; t = [0,1]
>>> 
>>>     # we assume deg(n) >= deg(m)
>>>     r.append(n)
>>>     r.append(m)
>>> 
>>>     # while the last remainder is nonzero
>>>     while r[-1] != 0:
>>> 
>>>         # long divide
>>>         (quo,rem) = r[-2].quo_rem(r[-1])
>>> 
>>>         # append remainder and latest Bézout coeffs
>>>         r.append(rem)
>>>         s.append(s[-2] - quo*s[-1])
>>>         t.append(t[-2] - quo*t[-1])
>>>     
>>>     # second to last remainder and coeffs
>>>     return r[-2], s[-2], t[-2]
```

Why is this procedure meaningful? Because we can quickly find a polynomial $n(x)s(x) + m(x)t(x)$ that's an associate of $x-1 \in \mathrm{GCD}\{n(x), m(x)\}$, i.e., we may find "scalars" $s$ and $t$ to form linear combination of $n(x)$ and $m(x)$ that generates the ideal $(x-1)$.

```python
>>> n = x^5 - 6*x + 5
>>> m = x^3 + 4*x^2 + x - 6
>>> ### extgcd returns a 3-tuple
>>> (gcd, s, t) = extgcd(n,m)
>>> print(gcd, s, t)

(11/100*x - 11/100, 1/50*x + 31/500, -1/50*x^3 + 9/500*x^2 - 13/250*x + 7/100)

>>> n*s + m*t == gcd

True
```

### [@DF04, number 9.3.3]

\gvn Let $F$ be a field. 

\wts The set $R$ of polynomials in $F[x]$ whose coefficient of $x$ is equal to $0$ is a subring of $F[x]$. Moreover, $R$ is not a UFD.

\pf Say $r(x), s(x) \in R$. Subtracting like powers, $r(x) - s(x) \in R$. Hence $(R, +)$ is an abelian subgroup of $F[x]$. Say that $r(x) = \sum_{i=0}^n r_i x^i$ and $s(x) = \sum_{j=0}^m s_j x^j$. Then 
$$r(x)s(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{mn} \sum_{i+j = k} r_i s_j x^k = r_0s_0 + \underbrace{r_1s_0 + r_0s_1}_{\text{ just }0}x + \text{ higher order terms } \in R.$$
We conclude $(R, \cdot)$ is a semigroup under the associative multiplication inherited from $F[x]$. (We could also say $1 \in R$.) So $R$ is a subring of $F[x]$.

Now consider $x^6 \in R$. Observe $(x^3)^2 = (x^2)^3 = x^6$. We'll show $x^2$ and $x^3$ are irreducible in $R$. Consider the possible factorizations, up to associates, of $x^2$ and $x^3$:

- $x^3 = x^0 x^3 = x^2 x^1$. The first factorization is not into irreducibles and the later is not in $R$.
- $x^2 = x^0 x^2 = x^2 x^1$. Dido. 

We conclude that $x^6$ has two distinct factorizations; therefore $R$ is not a UFD. \qedsymbol

### [@DF04, number 9.4.7]

\gvn The ring of polynomials $\RR[x]$ and the ideal generated by $x^2+1$.

\wts $\RR[x]/(x^2 + 1)$ is a field that's isomorphic to the complex numbers.

\pf We exhibit an isomorphism. Define $\phi \colon \CC \to \RR[x] / (x^2 + 1)$ by $a + bi \mapsto \bar{a} + \bar{bx}$ for all $a,b \in \RR$.

- $\phi$ is a well defined ring homomorphism. Additivity is clear, $\phi(\vec{u}) + \phi(\vec{v}) = \phi(\vec{u} + \vec{v})$. For multiplicativity, note in $\bar{\RR[x]}$ $\bar{0} = \bar{bd(x^2 + 1)}$. Exploit this! 
    \begin{align*}\phi(a+bi)\phi(c +di) &= \bar{ac} + \bar{adx} + \bar{bcx} + \bar{bdx^2}\\ &= \bar{ac - bd} + \bar{(ad + bc)x}\\ &= \phi((a+bi)(c + di)).\end{align*}
- $\phi$ is injective. For say (real numbers) $a \neq c$ or $b \ne d$. Then $\phi(a + bi) = \bar{a} + \bar{bx} \neq \bar{c} + \bar{dx} = \phi(c + di)$.
- $\phi$ is surjective by lemma. Recall for each $\bar{g(x)} \in R[x] / (x^2 + 1)$ there's a unique $r(x)$ of degree less than $2$ such that $\bar{r(x)} = \bar{g(x)}$. Whence $\{\bar{1}, \bar{x}\}$ is a basis for the vector space $\RR[x] / (x^2 + 1)$ over $\RR$. $\phi$ is an $\RR$-linear map and takes $1 \mapsto \bar{1}$ and $i \mapsto \bar{x}$.

We conclude the field of complex numbers $\CC$ is the extension of $\RR$ in which the polynomial $x^2 + 1$ has a root. \qedsymbol

### [@DF04, number 9.4.12]

\gvn The ring of polynomials $\ZZ[x]$ and the polynomial $x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} + \cdots + x + 1$. 

\wts $x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} + \cdots + x + 1$ is irreducible in $\ZZ[x]$ if and only if $n$ is a prime.

*Proof.*^[I consulted: <https://web.archive.org/web/20150524162238/https://crazyproject.wordpress.com/2011/01/03/prove-that-a-given-family-of-polynomials-is-reducible-over-zz/>. The ideal to massage the convolution in the case that $n$ is composite was not my own. The write-up was entirely my own.] \fore Suppose $p$ is prime. Then $\sum_{i=0}^{p-1} x^i = \Phi_p(x)$ is the $p$th cyclotomic polynomial. Consider the transformation $$\Phi_p(x+1) = \frac{(x + 1)^p -1}{x} = \sum_{k=1}^p {p \choose k} x^{k-1}.$$ We see $\Phi_p(x + 1)$ is a monic polynomial, with coefficients $$\frac{p!}{(p-k)!k!} \quad \text{ divisible by $p$ for } \quad k \in \{1, \ldots, p-1\}.$$ Further, $p^2 \nmid p$, the constant coefficient of $\Phi_p(x+1)$. Applying Eisenstein's criterion, we conclude $\Phi_p(x+1)$ (hence $\Phi_p(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{p-1} x^i$) is irreducible over $\ZZ[x]$.

\providecommand{\floor}[1]{\left \lfloor #1 \right \rfloor }

\back Suppose $n$ is composite. Consider $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x^i$. We'll reshape the indices of our sum from an $n \times 1$ vector down into a $d \times q$ matrix, where $n = dq$ for integers $d, q > 1$. A naive attempt would be to write $\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} \sum_{j = 0}^{q-1} x^{ij}$. One should verify $ij$ is a poor choice of exponent given that we're trying to establish a one-to-one correspondence between $\{0, \ldots, d - 1\} \times \{0, \ldots, q -1\}$ and $\{0, \ldots, n-1\}$. Rather, we rely on the (non-negative and therefore unique) division algorithm in $\ZZ$ to represent each $N \in \{0, \ldots, n-1\}$ *uniquely* as $N = di + j$ where $0 \le j < d.$ The range of the index $j$ forces $0 \le i \le \floor{\frac{n-1}{q}} = d- 1.$

By order considerations, the injection $(i,j) \mapsto di + j$ is a bijection between
$\{0, \ldots, d - 1\} \times \{0, \ldots, q -1\}$ and $\{0, \ldots, n-1\}$. We find here a reduction of $1 + x + \ldots + x^{n-1}$ into nonconstant polynomials: $$\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x^i = \sum_{i=0}^{d-1} \sum_{j = 0}^{q-1} x^{di + j} = \left( \sum_{i=0}^{d-1} x^{di}  \right)\left(\sum_{j = 0}^{q-1} x^{j}\right).\text{ \qedsymbol}$$

<!--
EX: Suppose $n$ is composite. Why is the polynomial $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x^i$ reducible in $\ZZ[x]$? ... There are indices $j, k$ such that $$\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x^i = \left( \sum_{j=0}^{d-1} x^{dj}  \right)\left(\sum_{k = 0}^{q-1} x^{k}\right).$$

### [@DF04, number 9.4.16]

\gvn Let $F$ be a field and let $a(x)$ be a polynomial of degree $n$ in $F[x]$. The polynomial $b(x) = x^n a(1/x)$ is called the reverse of $a(x)$.

*To demonstrate.* (a) Describe the coefficients of $b$ in terms of the coefficients of $a$. (b) $a$ is irreducible if and only if $b$ is irreducible. 

*Demonstration.*

(a) Both $a(x)$ and its reverse $b(x)$ have the same degree, the same number of coefficients, and are elements of the same polynomial ring $F[x]$. Explicitly, when $a(x) = \sum_1^n a_i$, $b_j = a_{n-j}$ and $b(x) = \sum_1^n b_j.$

(b) Say that $a(x)$ is reducible into $d(x)q(x)$, nonconstant polynomials in $F[x]$ of degree $m$ and $\ell$ respectively. Now $d(x)$ and $q(x)$ are nonconstant if and only if $x^m d(1/x)$ and $x^\ell q(1/x)$ are nonconstant (in $F[x]$), which occurs if and only if the reverse $x^{m\ell} a(1/x) = x^m d(1/x) x^\ell q(1/x)$ is reducible into nonconstant polynomials in $F[x]$. \qedsymbol

### A variant of Eisenstein's Criterion [@DF04, number 9.4.17]

\gvn Let $\fp$ be a prime ideal in the Unique Factorization Domain $R$ and let $a(x) = a_n x^n  + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0$ be a polynomial in $R[x]$, $n \ge 1$. Suppose $a_n \notin \fp$, $a_{n-1}, \ldots, a_0 \in \fp$ and $a_0 \notin \fp^2$. 

\wts $a(x)$ is irreducible in $F[x]$, where $F$ is the quotient field of $R$.

\pf Once we've established that $a(x)$ is irreducible in $R[x]$, by (the contrapositive to) Gauss' lemma, $a(x)$ will be irreducible in $F[x]$. So let $R$ and $\fp$ be as above. Let $a(x) \in R[x]$ with coefficients as above. To argue that $a(x)$ is irreducible in $R[x]$, we suppose it's not and approach a contradiction. So let $a(x) = b(x)c(x)$ for nonconstant polynomials $b(x),c(x)$ in $R[x]$. Consider residues under the reduction homomorphism $R[x] \to R/\fp [x]$. The equation $$a(x) = b(x)c(x) \quad \text{ in } R[x] \text{ reduces modulo $\fp$ to } \quad a_n x^n + \fp = \left(\sum (b_i + \fp)x^i\right)\left( \sum (c_j + \fp) x^j \right).$$ Because 

- $R/\fp$ is an integral domain^[I don't believe it's a UFD, but I could be wrong. In the case that $R = \ZZ$, reduction mod a prime $p$ *does* produce a UFD $\FF_p$.] and 
- the reduced polynomials satisfy $\deg \bar {a(x)} = \deg \bar {b(x)}+ \deg \bar{c(x)}$ 

it must be that *both residues* $\bar {b(x)}$ and $\bar {c(x)}$ have zero for their constant terms. That is, in $R/ \fp$, we have $b_0 + \fp = c_0 + \fp = \fp$. Pulling back to $R$, $a_0 = b_0c_0 \in \fp^2$---a contradiction! Our assumption that $a(x)$ is reducible must be faulty. \qedsymbol
