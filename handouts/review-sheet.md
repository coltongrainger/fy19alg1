#### Ravi Vakil

Syllabus from [Math 120: Groups and Rings](http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/14-120/). 

- Tues. Sept. 23: welcome; definition of group; isomorphism of groups. Words you should know: binary operation, associative, commutative, group, abelian, identity, inverse, group operation, cyclic group, symmetric (or permutation) group. You defined group homomorphism and isomorphism.
- Thurs. Sept. 25: Examples of groups, including symmetric groups (even infinite ones), matrix groups (linear algebra and group theory), field (e.g. integers mod p). Subgroups. Group actions.
- Sun. Sept. 28: Read up to chapter 2 by now (including the preliminaries chapter). You should know everything in Chapter 1 well except for the generators and relations section of 1.2 (which you should still read). You should try to digest chapter 2, and tell me (on the online assignment) which parts are the hardest to digest.
- Tues. Sept. 30: Isomorphisms. (Sub)groups generated by a set. Cyclic (sub)groups, finitely generated subgroups. Subgroups of Z/n? Group actions. Examples, including group action on g. Center, centralizer, normalizer, stabilizer.
- Thurs. Oct. 2: stabilizer, kernel, faithful. The information of a group action by G on a set A is the same as maps from G to S_A. Cosets of a subgroup. They "tile" the group. Lagrange's Theorem (if H is a subgroup of a finite group G, then |H| (the size=order of H) is a factor of |G|). The order of every element of G divides |G|. Fermat's Little Theorem, and Euler's fancier version of it. In trying to figure out quotients of groups by subgroups, you invented normal subgroups, and quotient groups.
- Sun. Oct. 5: Read 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 by now. 
- Tues. Oct. 7: Quotient sets and quotient groups. Propositions 13 and 14, and Corollary 15. The first and third isomorphism theorems.
- Thurs. Oct. 9: The isomorphism theorems. Composition series and simple groups. Introduction to the alternating group. 
- Sun. Oct. 12: Read 3.4, 3.5, 4.1, and 4.2 by now. 
- Tues. Oct. 14: impossibility of doubling the cube and trisecting a general angle.
- Thurs. Oct. 16: Group actions (kernel, stabilizer, faithful, transitive, orbit). Bijection between the cosets of Stab(a) in G, and the orbit of a. Cayley's Theorem. If p is the smallest prime dividing the order of a group G, then any index p subgroup of G is normal. 
- Sun. Oct. 19: Read 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, and 4.6 by now. 
- Tues. Oct. 21: class equation, automorphisms of groups, conjugation in the symmetric group, inner automorphisms, toward the simplicity of the alternating group A_n.
- Thurs. Oct. 23: More on automorphisms of groups. Simplicity of A_n. 
- Sun. Oct. 26: Read 5.1 and 5.2 by now (and reread 4.5). 
- Tues. Oct. 28: Statement of Sylow's Theorem. Applications, including classification of simple groups of size less than 60.
- Thurs. Oct. 30: Proof of Sylow's Theorem. 
- Tues. Nov. 4: direct products; classification of finite abelian groups; the fact that the units mod p are cyclic.
- Thurs. Nov. 6: identification of direct products; semidirect products.
- Tues. Nov. 11: midterm (in class). It will cover up until the statement and use of the Sylow theorems (and will include simplicity of the alternating group, which was done earlier).
- Thurs. Nov. 13: introduction to rings. Ideals.
- Sun. Nov. 16: read 5.4, 5.5, 7.1-7.4 by now.
- Tues. Nov. 18: properties of ideals. Euclidean domains are principal ideal domains.
- Sun. Nov. 30: read 7.5-8.3 by now.
- Tues. Dec. 2: unique factorization, and Fermat's two-square theorem.
- Thurs. Dec. 4: group theory and the Rubik's cube; review of class.
