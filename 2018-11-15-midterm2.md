### Subgroups of a symmetric group

Find explicit generators for subgroups of the symmetric group $S_7$ that are isomorphic to each of the groups (a) $\ZZ/4\ZZ\times \ZZ/2\ZZ$ (b) $\ZZ/2\ZZ\times \ZZ/2\ZZ \times \ZZ/2\ZZ$ and (c) $D_8$. Show also that $S_7$ has no subgroup isomorphic to $\ZZ/8\ZZ$ or $Q_8$.

*Demonstration.* By inspection:

- $C_2 \times C_4 \cong \langle (1\, 2), (3\, 4\, 5\, 6)\rangle$
- $C_2 \times C_2 \times C_2 \cong \langle (1\, 2), (3\, 4), (5\, 6)\rangle$
- $D_8 \cong \langle (1\, 2\, 3\, 4), (1\, 2)(3\, 4)\rangle$

The integer partitions of $7$ correspond bijectively to the disjoint cycle types (i.e., conjugacy classes) of the $7!$ elements of $S_7$. The order of an element of a given cycle type is the least common multiple of the disjoint cycle lengths. We list the integer partitions of $7$ explicitly

integer partition | least common multiple
--- | ---
$7$ | $7$
$6,1$ | $6$
$5,1,1$ | $5$
$5,2$ | $10$
$4,1,1,1$ | $4$
$4,2,1$ | $4$
$4,3$ | $12$
$3,1,1,1,1$ | $3$
$3,2,1,1$ | $6$
$3,2,2$ | $6$
$3,3,1$ | $3$
$2,1,1,1,1,1,1$ | $2$
$2,2,1,1,1$ | $2$
$2,2,2,1$ | $2$
$1,1,1,1,1,1,1$ | $1$

- Because $S_7$ has no element $x$ of order $8$, there cannot exist $H \leq S_7$ such that $H \cong C_8$.
- $Q_8$ has $3$ normal subgroups of order $4$ each pairwise incomparable under the relation "is a subgroup of", i.e.. "$\le$". Since normal subgroups are unions of conjugacy classes, a subgroup $H$ of $S_7$ could only have $2$ normal subgroups of order $4$ incomparable under the relation $\leq$. Should an isomorphism from $H \leq S_7$ to $Q_8$ exist, the lattice isomorphism theorem would produce a contradiction, as the relation $\leq$ is preserved under isomorphism (as well as the order of subgroups and their embedded normality). \qedsymbol

### Transitive group actions

\gvn Suppose $G$ acts transitively on sets $X$ and $Y$, where $1<|X|<|Y|=p$ and $p$ is prime. 

\wts G is not simple.

\pf For contradiction, suppose $G$ is a simple group. Since $G$ acts transitively on $X$, where $\abs{X} >1$, there's a *nontrivial* permutation representation $\pi \colon G \to S_X \cong S_n$. Now $\ker \pi \triangleleft G$ is a *proper* normal subgroup of the simple group $G$, so we must have $\ker \pi = \{1\}$. Since $\pi$ is injective, we identify $G$ with its image as a permutation group: 
$$G \le S_n.$$
Let $y \in Y$. By orbit-stabilizer, 
$$\abs{G} = \abs{G(y)}\cdot\abs{\Stab G y}.$$
$G$ acts transitively on $Y$, so $G(y) = Y$. Thus $$\abs{G} \text{ is divisible by } \abs{Y}.$$
Whence the contradiction: $\abs{Y} = p$ is a prime strictly greater than $n$, yet 
$$G \le S_n \quad \text{ implies, by Lagrange, } \quad p \mid n!\quad \text{ and this is absurd.}$$
So $G$ cannot be simple. \qedsymbol

<!---
We'll argue that $Y$ is a primitive $G$-set. Let $B$ be a nontrivial block in $Y$. Any image of $B$ in $Y$ under the action of any $\tau \in G$ will also be a block. Since $G$ is finite, one can find elements $\tau_1, \tau_2, \ldots, \tau_n$ such that $\{\tau_1(B), \tau_2(B), \ldots, \tau_n(B)\}$ is a partition of $Y$. Now for any $\tau \in G$, we have $\abs{\tau(B)} = \abs{B}$. Given the partition of $Y$ generated by the block $B$, we conclude $\abs{B} \mid \abs{Y}$. As $\abs{Y} =p$ is prime, it must be that $G$ acts primitively on $Y$.

### A homomorphism into a solvable group

\gvn Let $G$ be a finite group with a normal subgroup $N\triangleleft G$, and suppose $\theta\colon G\rightarrow H$ is a group homomorphism into a solvable group $H$. Suppose the commutator subgroup of $G/N$ is itself.

\wts $\theta(G)=\theta(N)$.

\pf $\theta$ induces $\phi \colon G/N \to \theta(g)\theta(N)$ such that $$gN\mapsto \theta(g)\theta(N).$$

Observe:

- $\phi$ is well defined. Let $g,h \in G$. Say $gN = hN$. Then $h^{-1}g \in N$. Under the homomorphism $\theta$, we see $$\theta(h^{-1}g) \in \theta(N),$$ so $\theta(g) \in \theta(h)\theta(N).$ Thus $$\theta(g)\theta(N) = \theta(h)\theta(N).$$

- $\phi$ is a homomorphism. For each $gN, hN\in G/N$, we have $$\phi(ghN) = \theta(gh)\theta(N) = \theta(g)\theta(N)\cdot\theta(h)\theta(N) = \phi(gN)\phi(hN).$$

- $\phi$ is surjective immediately from its definition.

Now $\theta(G) \le H$ implies $\theta(G)$ is solvable (it's a subgroup  of a solvable group). There's a natural epimorphism from $\theta(G)$ to $\theta(G)/\theta(N)$. So $$\theta(G)/\theta(N) \quad \text{ is solvable (it's homomorphic image of a solvable group).}$$

Under the hypothesis that $[G/N, G/N] = G/N$, we have $$\theta(G)/\theta(N) = \phi(G/N) = \phi([G/N, G/N]) = [\phi(G/N), \phi(G/N)] = [\theta(G)/\theta(N),\theta(G)/\theta(N)].$$

Since $\theta(G)/\theta(N)$ is solvable, its derived series must stabilize at $\{1\}$. So $\theta(G)/\theta(N) = \{1\}$. Thus $\theta(G) = \theta(N)$. \qedsymbol

### A semi-direct product

\gvn Let $G=H\ltimes U$ be a finite group for groups $H$ and $U$. Let $p$ be prime.

\wts 

(a) If $\Syl p G\cap \Syl p U\neq \emptyset$, then $\Syl p G=\Syl p U$. 

(b) If $\Syl p G\cap \Syl p U\neq \emptyset$ and $\gcd(|H|,|U|)=1$, then: 

> $H$ acts transitively on $\Syl p G$ if and only if $Q\triangleleft U$ for some $Q\in \Syl p G$.

\pf 

(a) Say $P \in \Syl p G \cap \Syl p U$. Now $G$ acts transitively on its Sylow $p$-subgroups by conjugation, so $$\Syl p G = \{gPg^{-1} : g \in G\}.$$ 
    To argue $\Syl p G \subset \Syl p U$. As $U\triangleleft G$, we know for all $g \in G$ that $gPg^{-1} \cap U \in \Syl p U$. Being conjugates in $U$, and considering finite order, $$\abs{gPg^{-1}} = \abs{P} = \abs{gPg^{-1}}.$$ It follows that $gPg^{-1} \cap U = gPg^{-1}$, hence $\Syl p G \subset \Syl p U$. The other inclusion is obvious by recognizing that if $\abs{P} = p^k$, then each $P_i \in \Syl p G$ also has order $p^k$, and is thus in $\Syl p G$.

(b) \back If $Q \triangleleft U$, then $1 = n_p(U) = n_p(G)$. We see $H$ acts transitively (trivially) on the singleton set $\Syl p G$. \fore Say that $H$ acts transitively on $\Syl p G$. It's true as well that $U$ acts transitively on $\Syl p U$ (which is identically $\Syl p U$). 

    Let $Q \in \Syl p G$. We compute the cardinal number of the orbit of $Q$ under the action of $H$ and $U$ respectively:
$$n_p(G) = \frac{\abs{H}}{\abs{\N H Q}} \quad \text{ and } \quad n_p(G) = \frac{\abs{U}}{\abs{\N U Q}}.$$

    So the cardinal number of the orbit of $Q$ (which is the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of both $U$ and $G$) divides both $\abs{H}$ and $\abs{U}$. Since $\gcd(\abs{H}, \abs{U}) = 1$, it must be that $Q$ is the only Sylow $p$-subgroup in $U$ (and, also, the only one in $G$). We conclude $Q \triangleleft U$. \qedsymbol

### No simple group of order $120$

\gvn Suppose $G$ is a group of order $120$.

\wts $G$ cannot be simple.

\pf Suppose for contradiction $G$ is simple. As $\abs{G} = 2^3\cdot3\cdot5$, by Sylow we have:

- The minimal permissible index of a proper subgroup of $G$ is $5$,
    - that is, $5 = \min\{k \in \NN : \abs{G} \mid k!\}$;
- The number of Sylow $p$-groups must be 
    - $n_5 = 6$, 
    - $n_3 \in \{10,40\}$, 
    - $n_2 \in \{5,15\}$.

We consider $n_5 = 6$ to obtain a contradiction. Let $H_5 \in \Syl 5 G$. Then  $G$ acts transitively by conjugation on $G/\N G {H_5}$. I assert $$G \le S_6$$ by identifying $G$ with its image in $S_6$ afforded by the (necessarily injective) permutation representation $G \to S_6$. As $G$ has no subgroup of index $2$, $G \le A_6$. Since $\abs{A_6} = 6!/2$, it's the case that Sylow $5$-subgroups of $G$ coincide with Sylow $5$-subgroups of $A_6$. It follows that $$\N {A_6} {H_5} \ge \N {A_6} {H_5} \cap G =  \N G {H_5}.$$ 

Now, the number of Sylow $5$-subgroups of $S_6$ is given by the number of $5$-cycles divided by the number of $p$-cycles in a Sylow $p$-subgroup. In particular, $$\abs{\N {A_6}{H_5}} = \frac12 \abs{\N {S_6}{H_5}} =10.$$ Yet also $n_5(G) = 6$ is the index of the normalizer of $H_5$ in $G$, hence $$\abs{\N G {H_5}} = 20.$$ But $\N G {H_5}$ of order $20$ cannot be contained in a group of order $10$---the desired contradiction. 

We conclude $n_5$ cannot be $6$ for a simple group $G$ of order $120$. So no such simple group $G$ exists. \qedsymbol

### Comaximal Ideals

\gvn Let $R=I+J$ be a commutative ring with identity where $I$ and $J$ are two ideals.

\wts 

(a) $IJ=I\cap J$. 

(b) There are instances where $I+J\neq R$ and $IJ\neq I\cap J$.

\pf 

(a) To verify $IJ$ is an ideal contained in $I \cup J$. 

    - $IJ$ is nonempty and closed under addition, following immediately from $IJ$'s definition.
    - $IJ$ is closed under multiplication, for let $\sum_1^n x_iy_i \in IJ$ and $r \in R$. 
        - Then $r\sum_1^n x_iy_i \sum_1^n \underbrace{(rx_i)}_{\in I}y_i \in IJ.$ 
    - So $IJ$ is an ideal. 
    - As $I,J$ are ideals, we have $\sum_1^n \underbrace{x_i y_i}_{\in I \cup J} \in I\cup J$. 
    - Thus $IJ \subset I \cup J$.

    To verify that $I\cap J = IJ$, we require the hypotheses that $R$ is a commutative unital ring with comaximal ideals $I$ and $J$. 
    
    - Let $z \in I\cap  J$. 
    - As $I + J = R$, we may find $e_I \in I$ and $e_J \in J$ such that $e_I +  e_J = 1$. 
    - Since $I+J$ contains $IJ$, $z \in I+J$. 
    - Then $z = z\cdot 1 = ze_I + e_Jz \in IJ$.
    - So $I \cap J \subset IJ$.

(b) Consider $R = \ZZ$ and $I=J=n\ZZ$ for $n \in \ZZ_{\ge 2}$. Since $gcd(n,n) = n$, we have $n\ZZ + n\ZZ = n\ZZ \neq \ZZ$. Furthermore $IJ = n^2\ZZ$, yet $I\cap J = n\ZZ$.
