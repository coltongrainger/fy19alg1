### Subgroups of the symmetric group

Find explicit generators for subgroups of the symmetric group $S_7$ that are isomorphic to each of the groups (a) $\ZZ/4\ZZ\times \ZZ/2\ZZ$ (b) $\ZZ/2\ZZ\times \ZZ/2\ZZ \times \ZZ/2\ZZ$ and (c) $D_8$. Show also that $S_7$ has no subgroup isomorphic to $\ZZ/8\ZZ$ or $Q_8$.

*Demonstration.* By inspection:

- $C_2 \times C_4 \cong \langle (1\, 2), (3\, 4\, 5\, 6)\rangle$
- $C_2 \times C_2 \times C_2 \cong \langle (1\, 2), (3\, 4), (5\, 6)\rangle$
- $D_8 \cong \langle (1\, 2\, 3\, 4), (1\, 2)(3\, 4)\rangle$

The integer partitions of $7$ correspond bijectively to the disjoint cycle types (i.e., conjugacy classes) of the $7!$ elements of $S_7$. The order of an element of a given cycle type is the least common multiple of the disjoint cycle lengths. We list the integer partitions of $7$ explicitly

integer partition | least common multiple
--- | ---
$7$ | $7$
$6,1$ | $6$
$5,1,1$ | $5$
$5,2$ | $10$
$4,1,1,1$ | $4$
$4,2,1$ | $4$
$4,3$ | $12$
$3,1,1,1,1$ | $3$
$3,2,1,1$ | $6$
$3,2,2$ | $6$
$3,3,1$ | $3$
$2,1,1,1,1,1,1$ | $2$
$2,2,1,1,1$ | $2$
$2,2,2,1$ | $2$
$1,1,1,1,1,1,1$ | $1$

- Because $S_7$ has no element $x$ of order $8$, there cannot exist $H \leq S_7$ such that $H \cong C_8$.
- $Q_8$ has $3$ normal subgroups of order $4$ each pairwise incomparable under the relation "is a subgroup of", i.e.. "$\le$". Since normal subgroups are unions of conjugacy classes, a subgroup $H$ of $S_7$ could only have $2$ normal subgroups of order $4$ incomparable under the relation $\leq$. Should an isomorphism from $H \leq S_7$ to $Q_8$ exist, the lattice isomorphism theorem would produce a contradiction, as the relation $\leq$ is preserved under isomorphism (as well as the order of subgroups and their embedded normality). \qedsymbol

### Transitive action on a $G$-set of prime degree

\gvn Suppose $G$ acts transitively on sets $X$ and $Y$, where $1<|X|<|Y|=p$ and $p$ is prime. 

\wts G is not simple.

\pf

\newpage

### Homomorphisms into solvable groups 

\gvn Let $G$ be a finite group with a normal subgroup $N\triangleleft G$, and suppose $\theta\colon G\rightarrow H$ is a group homomorphism into a solvable group $H$. Suppose the commutator subgroup of $G/N$ is itself.

\wts $\theta(G)=\theta(N)$.

\pf $\Theta$ induces $\phi \colon G/N \to \theta(g)\theta(N)$ such that $$gN\mapsto \theta(g)\theta(N).$$

Observe:

- $\phi$ is well defined. Let $g,h \in G$. Say $gN = hN$. Then $h^{-1}g \in N$. Under the homomorphism $\theta$, we see $\theta(h^{-1}g) \in \theta(N)$, so $\theta(g) \in \theta(h)\theta(N)$. Thus $\theta(g)\theta(N) = \theta(h)\theta(N)$.
- $\phi$ is a homomorphism. For any $gN, hN\in G/N$, we have $$\phi(ghN) = \theta(gh)\theta(N) = (\theta(g)\theta(N))(\theta(h)\theta(N)) = \phi(gN)\phi(hN).$$
- Note $\phi$ is surjective immediately from its definition.

Now $\theta(G) \le H$ implies $\theta(G)$ is solvable (it's a subgroup  of a solvable group). There's a natural epimorphism from $\theta(G)$ to $\theta(G)/\theta(N)$. So $\theta(G)/\theta(N)$ is solvable (it's homomorphic image of a solvable group). Under the hypotheses that $[G/N, G/N] = G/N$, we have $$\theta(G)/\theta(N) = \phi(G/N) = \phi([G/N, G/N]) = [\phi(G/N), \phi(G/N)] = [\theta(G)/\theta(N),\theta(G)/\theta(N)].$$

Since $\theta(G)/\theta(N)$ is solvable, its derived series must stabilize at $\{1\}$. So $\theta(G)/\theta(N) = \{1\}$. Thus $\theta(G) = \theta(N)$. \qedsymbol

### Sylow subgroups

\gvn Let $G=H\ltimes U$ be a finite group for groups $H$ and $U$. Let $p$ be prime.

\wts (i) If $\Syl_p(G)\cap \Syl_p(U)\neq \emptyset$, then $\Syl_p(G)=\Syl_p(U)$. (ii) If $\Syl_p(G)\cap \Syl_p(U)\neq \emptyset$ and $\gcd(|H|,|U|)=1$, then: $H$ acts transitively on $\Syl_p(G)$ if and only if $Q\triangleleft U$ for some $Q\in \Syl_p(G)$.

\pf

### Groups of order $120$

\gvn Suppose $G$ is a group of order $120$.

\wts $G$ cannot be simple.

\pf We proceed with Sylow's theorem, and argue for a contradiction. So suppose $G$ is simple. As $\abs{G} = 2^3\cdot3\cdot5$, we have:

- The minimal permissible index of a proper subgroup of $G$ is $5$,
    - for $5 = \min\{k \in \NN : \abs{G} \mid k!\}$;
- the number of Sylow $p$-groups are given $n_5 = 6$, $n_3 \in \{10,40\}$, $n_2 \in \{5,15\}$;
- $n_2 =15$ else "$G \le S_5$", which forces, by order considerations, "$A_5 \triangleleft G$".

We only need to consider $n_5 = 6$ to obtain a contradiction. For let $H_5 \in \Syl 5 G$. Then consider $G$ acting transitively by conjugation on $G/\N G {H_5}$. Then $G \le S_6$, if we identify $G$ with its image in $S_6$ afforded by the (necessarily injective) permutation representation $G \to S_6$. As $G$ has no subgroup of index $2$, $G \le A_6$. Consider that $$\N {A_6} {H_5} \ge \N {A_6} {H_5} \cap G =  \N G {H_5}.$$ Now $\abs{\N G {H_5}} = 20$ and $\abs{\N {A_6}{H_5}} = \frac12 \abs{\N {S_6}{H_5}} =10$. Yet $\N G {H_5}$ of order $20$ cannot be contained in a group of order $10$---which is our desired contradiction. In particular this shows $n_5 \neq 6$ for a simple group of order $120$. So no such simple group exists. \qedsymbol

### Sums and products of ideals

\gvn Let $R=I+J$ be a commutative ring with identity where $I$ and $J$ are two ideals.

\wts (a) $IJ=I\cap J$. (b) There are instances where $I+J\neq R$ and $IJ\neq I\cap J$.

\pf Let $R$ be a ring with unity $1\neq 0$. Let $I,J$ be ideals of $R$.

(a) If $K$ is an ideal such that $I \cup J \subset K \subset I+J$, then $K=I+J$. (b) $IJ$ is an ideal contained in $I\cap J$. (c) The containment in (b) may be proper. (d) If $R$ happens to be commutative, then we have equality in (b).

(a) $I, J \subset I+J$. Suppose $K$ is as above. Let $x+y \in I+J$. Observe $x,y \in K$. So $x+y \in K$ and thus $I+J \in K$.

(a) We verify that $IJ$ is an ideal. Immediately from its definition, $IJ$ is nonempty and closed under addition. Let $\sum_1^n x_iy_i \in IJ$ and $r \in R$. Then
$$r\sum_1^n x_iy_i \sum_1^n \underbrace{(rx_i)}_{\in I}y_i \in IJ.$$ So $IJ$ is an ideal. Moreover, $I,J$ are ideals, so $\sum_1^n \underbrace{x_i y_i}_{\in I \cup J} \in I\cup J$. Thus $IJ \subset I \cup J$.

    We verify that if $R$ is a commutative unital ring with comaximal ideals $I$ and $J$, then $I\cap J = IJ$. Let $z \in I\cap  J$. Now $z \in I+J$ also, so there are $x,y$ in $I,J$ respectively such that $x+y = z$. Then $z = x1 + 1y \in IJ$. 

(b) Consider $R = \ZZ$ and $I=J=n\ZZ$ for $n \in \ZZ_{\ge 2}$. Since $gcd(n,n) = n$, we have $n\ZZ + n\ZZ = n\ZZ \neq \ZZ$. Furthermore $IJ = n^2\ZZ$, yet $I\cap J = n\ZZ$.
