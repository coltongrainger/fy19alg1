### A $\QQ$-vector space with a radical basis [@DF04, number 1.1.8]

Let $G = \left\{a + b\sqrt{2} \in \RR : a,b \in \QQ\right\}$.

(a) We'll show $G$ is a group under addition.

(b) Further, we'll show that the nonzero elements of $G$ form a group under multiplication.

### The dressing-undressing principle [@DF04, number 1.1.15]

Suppose $G$ is a group. 

We'll prove that $(a_1 a_2 \ldots a_n)^{-1} =  a_n^{-1}a_{n-1}^{-1}\ldots a_1^{-1}$ for all $a_1, a_2 \ldots a_n \in G$.

### Every element its own inverse [@DF04, number 1.1.25]

If $x^2 = 1$ for every element $x \in G$ then $G$ is abelian.

### Direct products of groups [@DF04, number 1.1.28]

Suppose that $(A, \star)$ and $(B, \diamond)$ are groups. 
We verify that the direct product $A \times B$ satisfies the group axioms.

(a) The binary operation is associative.

(b) The identity exists.

(c) Inverses exist.

### Abelian groups and their direct products [@DF04, number 1.1.29]

We prove that $A \times B$ is an abelian group if and only if both $A$ and $B$ are abelian.

### Dihedral groups of odd regular polygons [@DF04, number 1.2.5]

Suppose $n$ is odd and $n \geq 3$. 
Then the identity is the only element in the dihedral group $D_{2n}$ that commutes with all elements of $D_{2n}$.

### Computing permutations [@DF04, number 1.3.1]

Consider the permutations 
$$\sigma = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ 2 & 4 & 5 & 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix}, 
\tau = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ 5 & 3 & 2 & 4 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.$$

We'll find the cycle decompositions of $\sigma$, $\tau$, $\sigma^2$, $\sigma\tau$, $\tau\sigma$, and $\tau^2\sigma$.

### Cycle decompositions in $S_4$ [@DF04, number 1.3.6]

We list the cycle decompositions for all elements in $S_4$ of order $4$.

### The LCM of lengths of cycles [@DF04, number 1.3.15]

We prove that the order of an element in $S_n$ is equal to the least common multiple of the lengths of the cycles in its cycle decomposition.

### Order of elements in $S_5$ [@DF04, number 1.3.18]

We find all numbers $n$ such that $S_5$ contains and element of order $n$.

### Hamilton's quaternion group [@DF04, number 1.5.1]

To compute the order of each element in $Q_8 = \{1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k\}$ we recall Hamilton's fundamental formula [@Ha1866, Ch. II] $$i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk.$$
