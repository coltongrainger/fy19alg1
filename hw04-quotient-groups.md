### [@DF04, number 2.5.12]

The group $A = Z_2 \times Z_4 = \langle a,b | a^2 = b^4 =1, ab = ba\rangle$ has order $8$ has three subgroups of order $4$. They are 

- $\langle a,b^2 \rangle \cong V_4$, $\langle b\rangle \cong Z_4$, and $\langle ab\rangle \cong Z_4$. 

Now every proper subgroup of $A$ is contained in one of these three. 

We draw the lattice of subgroups of $A$, with each subgroup expressed in terms of at most two generators.

### [@DF04, number 2.5.13]

The group $G = Z_2 \times Z_8 = \langle x,y : x^2 = y^8 = 1, xy = yx\rangle$ has order $16$ has three subgroups of order $8$. They are 

- $\langle x, y^2\rangle \cong Z_2 \times Z_4$, $\langle y \rangle \cong Z_8$, and $\langle xy \rangle \cong Z_8$.

We draw the lattice of subgroups of $G$, again with each subgroup expressed in terms of at most two generators.

### [@DF04, number 2.5.14]

Let $M$ be the (*modular*) group of order $16$ with the following presentation:

$$\langle u, v : u^2 = v^8 = 1, vu = uv^5 \rangle$$

$M$ has three subgroups of order $8$, they are 

- $\langle u,v^2 \rangle$, $\langle v\rangle$, $\langle uv \rangle$. 

Now the lattice of subgroups of $M$ is the same as the lattice of subgroups of $G$, but the two groups $M$ and $G$ are not isomorphic.

### [@DF04, number 3.1.11]

Let $F$ be a field and consider the subgroup of upper triangular matrices in $GL_2(\FF)$, $$K = \left\{\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ 0 & c \end{pmatrix} : a, b, c \in \FF, ac \neq 0 \right\}$$

(a) The map $\phi: \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ 0 & c \end{pmatrix} \mapsto a$ is a surjective homomorphism from $G$ onto $\FF^\times$ (the multiplicative group of nonzero elements in $\FF$). We describe the fibers and kernel of $\phi$.

(b) The map $\psi: \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ 0 & c \end{pmatrix} \mapsto (a,c)$ is a surjective homomorphism from $G$ onto $\FF^\times \times \FF^\times$. We describe the fibers and kernel of $\psi$.

(c) Let $H$ be the subgroup of unit upper triangular matrices[^uut] in $GL_2(\FF)$. Then $H \cong \FF$ (the additive group).

[^uut]: A *unit* upper triangular matrix is an upper triangular matrix with $1$ in each diagonal entry. In the $2\times 2$ case, the unit upper triangular matrices are completely determined by the element $b \in \FF$ in row $1$, column $2$. The isomorphism should be clear.

### [@DF04, number 3.1.19]

\newcommand{\h}[1]{\overline{#1}}

Let $M$ be the modular group of order $16$ and let $\h M = M/\langle\sigma^4\rangle$ be the quotient of $M$ by the (normal) subgroup generated by $\sigma^4$.

(a) The order of $\h M$ is $8$.

(b) Each element of $\h G$ is of the form $\h\tau^a\h\sigma^b$ for some integers $a$ and $b$.

(c) The order of each of the elements in part (b) is given.

(d) We reduce the following elements of $\h M$ to their "least residue" (i.e., to the form $\h\tau^a\h\sigma^b$).

    - $\h{\sigma\tau}$
    - $\h{\tau\sigma^{ -2 }\tau}$
    - $\h{\tau^{-1}\sigma^{-1}\tau\sigma}$

(e) $\h M \cong D_8$.

### [@DF04, number 3.1.22]

(a) If $H$ and $K$ are normal subgroups of a group $G$ then their intersection $H \cap K$ is also a normal subgroup of $G$.

(b) The intersection of an arbitrary nonempty collection of normal subgroups of a group is a normal subgroup.

### [@DF04, number 3.1.36]

If $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic then $G$ is abelian.^[If $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic with generator $xZ(G)$, every element of $G$ can be written in the form $x^a z$ for some integer $a \in \ZZ$ and some element $z \in Z(G)$.]

### [@DF04, number 3.1.41]

Let $G$ be a group. Then *commutator subgroup* $N = x^{-1}y^{-1}xy : xy \in G \rangle$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, also for which the quotient group $G/N$ is abelian.

### [@DF04, number 3.2.4]

A finite abelian group has a subgroup of order $n$ for each positive divisor $n$ of its order.

### [@DF04, number 3.2.9]

A proof of Cauchy's theorem.^[Due to James McKay (*Another proof of Cauchy's group theorem*, Amer. Math. Monthly, 66(1959), p. 119)]

Let $G$ be a finite group and let $p$ be a prime dividing $\order{G}$. Let $S$ denote the set of $p$-tuples of elements of $G$ the product of whose coordinates is $1$: 
$$S = \left\{(x_1 , x_2, \ldots, x_p) : x_i \in G \text{ and } x_1x_2 \cdots x_p = 1\right\}.$$

(a) $S$ has $\order{G}^{p-1}$ elements, hence has order divisible by $p$. 

Define the relation $\sim$ on $S$ by letting $\alpha \sim \beta$ if $\beta$ is a cyclic permutation of $\alpha$. 

(b) A cyclic permutation of an element of $S$ is again an element of $S$. 
(c) $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on S.
(d) An equivalence class in $S$ contains a single element if and only if it is of the form $(x, x, \ldots, x)$ with $x^p = 1$.
(e) Every equivalence class has order $1$ or $p$ (note that p is a prime). Whence $\order{G}^{p-1} = k + pd$, where $k$ is the number of classes of size $1$ and $d$ is the number of classes of size $p$.
(f) Since $\{(1, 1, \ldots , 1)\}$ is an equivalence class of size $1$, from (e) there must be a nonidentity element $x$ in $G$ with $x^p = 1$, that is, $G$ contains an element of order $p$. (We show $p | k$ and so $k > 1$.)

### [@DF04, number 3.2.18]

Let $G$ be a finite group, let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ and let $N \trianglelefteq G$. If $\order{H}$ and $\order{G : N}$ are relatively prime then $H \le N$.

### Minimal and maximal subgroups

Suppose $N$ is a nontrivial abelian subgroup of $G$, minimal with the property that it is normal in $G$. Let $H$ be a proper subgroup of $G$ such that $NH=G$. The intersection of $N$ with $H$ is trivial and $H$ is a maximal subgroup of $G$.

Problems revised for completion.

### An automorphism fixed point free [@DF04, number 1.6.23]

Let $G$ be a finite group which possesses an automorphism $\sigma$ such that $\sigma(g) = g$ if and only if $g=1$. If $\sigma^2$ is the identity map from $G$ to $G$, then $G$ is abelian.^[*Hint*. Every element of $G$ can be written in the form $x^{-1}\sigma(x)$. Apply $\sigma$ to such an expression.]

*Proof sketch.* Suppose $G$ is finite and there's an automorphism $\sigma$ of $G$ such that $\sigma$ fixes $g \in G$ if and only if $g = 1$. Further suppose that $\sigma^2 = \mathrm{id}_G$.

Knowing that $G$ is finite, that $\sigma$ is a bijection, and that each $x^{-1}$ is corresponds uniquely with $x \in G$, apply the pigeon hole principle to write every element of $y \in G$ *uniquely* as $y = x^{-1}\sigma(x)$. Now take $$\sigma(y) = \sigma(x^{-1}\sigma(x)) = \sigma(x^{-1})\sigma^2(x) = \sigma(x)^{-1}\mathrm{id}_G(x).$$

TODO. Show $G$ is abelian.

### [@DF04, number 2.2.10]

Let $H$ be a subgroup of order $2$ in $G$. Then $N_G(H) = C_G(H)$. 

*Proof by set inclusion.* ($\subset$) Suppose $g \in N_G(H)$. Because $H$ is a group of order $2$, it is $\{1, x\}$ where $x^2 = 1$. If conjugation by $g$ fixes $H$, then $\{g1g^{-1}, gxg^{-1}\} = \{1, x\}$. Whence $\{1, gxg^{-1}\} = \{1, x\}$. For set equality, we must have $gxg^{-1} = x$. So $g \in C_G(H)$. ($\supset$) By definition, if $g \in C_G(H)$, then $g$ fixes each $h \in H$ by conjugation, so $g$ fixes $H$ by conjugation. \qedsymbol

Also, if $N_G(H) = G$, then $H \le Z(G)$. TODO.

### [@DF04, number 2.4.16]


A subgroup $M$ of a group $G$ is called a *maximal subgroup* if $M \neq G$ and the only subgroups of $G$ which contain $M$ are $M$ itself and $G$.

(a) If $H$ is a proper subgroup of the finite group $G$, then there is a maximal subgroup of $G$ containing $H$. 

    Consider the elements in $G \setminus H$. Let $\order{G \setminus H} = \order{G} - \order{H} = m$. There are then $2^m -1$ proper 
subsets of $G$ containing $H$. Either $H$ is it's own maximal group in $G$, or one of the $2^m -1$ proper subsets is a maximal group.

(b) The subgroup of all rotations in a dihedral group is a maximal subgroup.

    The set of rotations in $D_8$ is a subgroup of order $4$. Now every other subgroup of $D_8$ has an order which divides $8$, of which $4$ is the largest order strictly less than $8$. So the set of rotations is maximal in $D_8$, for the only subgroups it is properly contained in are $D_8$ and itself.

(c) If $G = \langle x\rangle$ is a cyclic subgroup of order $n \ge 1$, then a subgroup $H$ is maximal if and only if $H = \langle x^p \rangle$ for some prime $p$ dividing $n$.

### Maximal subgroups in a finite group

A finite group with no more that two maximal subgroups is cyclic.

### [@DF04, number 3.1.40]

Let $G$ be a group, let $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$ and let $\h G = G/N$. The elements $\h x$ and $\h y$ commute in $\h G$ if and only if $x^{-1}y^{-1}xy  \in N$. (We call the element $x^{-1}y^{-1}xy$ the *commutator* of $x$ and $y$, denoted by $[x,y]$.)
